<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>The life-story of Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart contained in this volume closes
with his admission to membership in the
Accademia Filarmonica at Bologna, Italy.
Mozart was then in his fifteenth year. Up to that
time his life had been a happy one, free from care,
untouched by adversity, and crowned with continuous
successes. He was admired by the people,
considered a prodigy by the greatest composers,
and was received with extraordinary honors at the
Courts of Austria, France, Holland, and England.
His twenty remaining years, embittered by enmities
and saddened by privations and misfortunes, find
no place in this life-story. They were occupied
almost exclusively with artistic tours, during which
he brought out many of his greatest works, among
them, &ldquo;Mitridate,&rdquo; &ldquo;Idomeneo,&rdquo; &ldquo;Marriage of
Figaro,&rdquo; &ldquo;Don Giovanni,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Magic Flute.&rdquo;
The last-named opera made its appearance in 1789,
and the same year he began the immortal &ldquo;Requiem,&rdquo;
the composition of which was so significant
in its relation to his rapidly approaching end. He
died two years later. He was then in impoverished
circumstances. His funeral was of the kind common
among the poorest class. No note of music was
heard. No friend accompanied the solitary hearse
to the cemetery where this great genius was left in a
pauper&rsquo;s grave. His life-story in this volume leaves
him crowned with honors, the idol of his time, a marvel
to the greatest musicians, flushed with success
and exultant in the pride of genius, standing on the
threshold of youthful manhood, the brightest, most
beautiful, most attractive, most lovable figure in
the world of music. It is one of the attractions of
this little volume that it takes leave of him there,
before the sunshine of his life was obscured by a
single cloud.</p>

<p>Vice Chapelmaster Leopold Mozart<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> of
Salzburg paced to and fro in his apartment,
evidently disturbed and anxious.
He stopped several times at the door
of the adjoining room and listened intently to
every sound within. Then he would resume his
monotonous walk from one corner of the room to
another. From time to time he whispered a hurried
prayer. Great drops of sweat fell from his brow.
His face was pale, and showed unmistakable signs
of trouble and misgiving.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>The hands of the house clock, which persistently
kept up its monotonous ticking, moved slowly forward.
Minute after minute passed, and with every
minute the vice chapelmaster grew more and more
anxious. A piano stood at one side of the room.
To divert his thoughts he went to it, and with
trembling hands struck a few chords, whose soft,
full tones seemed to exert a quieting influence upon
him. He wiped the perspiration from his brow,
and his dimmed eyes grew brighter as he went to
the window and looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the dear God do as He wills,&rdquo; he gently
said to himself. &ldquo;He will surely do everything
that is for our best and highest good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood at the window several minutes with
clasped hands and uplifted eyes. The sky was
overcast with dark clouds, with here and there
occasional glimpses of the blue. The air was sultry
and oppressive, and seemed to threaten a storm.
Suddenly the dark cloud-veil was rent, as it were,
and the dazzling sun shed a brilliantly glorious
flood of light upon the beautiful scenery of Salzburg.
The glistening sunbeams also streamed into
the vice chapelmaster&rsquo;s room, and Father Mozart
welcomed them with a serene smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, it is as if the eye of God were shining
out of heaven in token of his inexhaustible goodness
and mercy,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I will
accept it as a good omen, Lord, my God.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>A cheery little nurse with smiling face entered,
carrying in her arms a little boy, vigorously crowing
and kicking.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Herr Vice Chapelmaster,&rdquo; she said with
an expression of the heartiest delight; &ldquo;this is what
the beautiful sunlight, even yet glistening upon the
roofs like gold, has brought us. If this is not a
good omen, why, then, I am no prophet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vice chapelmaster stretched out his arms to
the little boy, held his hands in blessing over his
head, and made no effort to restrain the tears of joy
which ran down his cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God and Lord,&rdquo; he said with trembling
voice, &ldquo;accept my thanks for this happy moment,
and let Thy blessing rest upon the head of this
child whom Thou hast given me for my comfort.&rdquo;
Thereupon he bent down, kissed the boy&rsquo;s forehead,
and looked at him for some time with an expression
of the greatest delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the mother,<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> my good woman?&rdquo; he asked
hastily, as if awakening from a beautiful dream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;All is well, Herr Vice Chapelmaster,&rdquo; was her
reply. &ldquo;The dear little woman is as lively as a
fish in the water. See for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He needed no second invitation. In three steps
the happy father was in the next room. His wife,
somewhat pale, smilingly stretched out both her
delicate hands, which Father Mozart affectionately
kissed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear wife, you have made me very happy,&rdquo;
he said in a tone which came straight from the heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not any happier than I feel myself,&rdquo; the mother
replied. &ldquo;Let us both praise God for His merciful
help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I must insist that you do your praising
apart from each other,&rdquo; interposed the woman, who
stood one side with the still vigorously kicking and
screaming boy in her arms. &ldquo;You must withdraw
at once, Herr Vice Chapelmaster, for your little wife
must have some rest. You ought to be satisfied,
for you have seen with your own eyes that everything
has been done for the best. So go, or I shall
be offended.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Father Mozart smilingly obeyed, after he had
kissed his wife, and returned to his room. He
could not keep quiet long, however. His heart
was too full. He must relieve it in the glorious
freedom of nature. He took his hat and cane,
quietly slipped out of the house, and hurried through
the narrow streets of Salzburg to the beautiful
avenue leading to the Archbishop&rsquo;s ch&acirc;teau at Heilbronn.
Here he could give vent to his feelings
without interruption or restraint, for the avenue
was usually quiet, and frequented by only a few
solitary pedestrians.</p>
<p>Father Mozart, ordinarily a very calm, sedate,
self-possessed man, was hardly himself to-day, for
by the blessing of God a wish, long and secretly
cherished in his heart, had been realized. A little
son had been given him. When he reflected that
he would educate and instruct him, inspire him in
his early years with a love for his beautiful art of
music, and, with divine aid, develop him into a
great musician, a thousand hymns of joy exultantly
sang themselves in his heart, and his fancy painted
bright pictures of the future. He was oblivious of
all around him. He had no eyes for the attractions
of the unsurpassably beautiful country stretching out
in every direction like a blooming garden. He
thought of nothing but his little son. He rubbed
his hands together exultantly, muttered unintelligible
words to himself, looked up with radiant glance into
the blue and now cloudless sky, and so far forgot
himself as to indulge in loud and joyous peals of
laughter&mdash;laughing upon the public highway!&mdash;something
which no one before had ever known the
vice chapelmaster to do. He acted really like one
completely beside himself, and so absent-mindedly,
indeed, that he failed to observe a gentleman approaching
him from Heilbronn, who had been
watching him for some little time with a quiet
smile. The new-comer stepped behind a tree trunk,
and as the happy father was going by without seeing
him, he came up behind him, tapped him on the
shoulder, and said in good-natured banter:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, why, my respected friend and vice chapelmaster
Leopold Mozart, what kind of a whimsical
notion are you carrying about in your pate that
makes you behave on the public thoroughfares like
one out of his senses? Never before in all my life
have I seen you laughing and acting like this. It
must be something extraordinary that has brought
about such a radical change.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">

<p class="caption"><i>He failed to observe a gentleman who had been watching him with a quiet smile</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess, friend Adlgasser,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> replied Mozart, good-humoredly,
as he freely joined in the laughter of his
old, true friend, who had been appointed court
musician in the chapel of the Archbishop of Salzburg.
&ldquo;Guess! Indeed, it is something extraordinary.
Just think of it, Adlgasser, when the sunshine
first broke through the dark clouds to-day, the dear
God gave us a strong, healthy baby, at the very instant
of the first gleam! Is not that well-nigh a miracle,
and should not a father&rsquo;s heart leap for joy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, friend, if that is the case, all is explained,
and I congratulate you as an honest friend and
faithful comrade should,&rdquo; replied Adlgasser, as
with joyous face he stretched out both hands to
the vice chapelmaster. &ldquo;My hearty good wishes.
May the little one grow up to be a joy to us all,
and some time become as skilful a musician as his
father, our always esteemed Leopold Mozart. It
surely was a significant omen, for it means that this
little one will some day illuminate the whole world
like the sun, and all the earth will regard him with
admiration as a true light from heaven. I do not
know whence the thought comes to me, Mozart,
but I have a presentiment that this is not only
true, but that he will accomplish this result in a
very short time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;God grant that you speak truly, dear friend,&rdquo;
replied Mozart, excitedly. &ldquo;At least, let us hope
we may live to take comfort with the little one, and
that we may bring him up to be a valiant follower
of our noble Mistress Musica.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen! may it be so,&rdquo; said Adlgasser, heartily
shaking the vice chapelmaster&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Arm in arm the two went on, discussing for
some time the little world-citizen who had come
fresh from the other side with the sunbeams, until
the sky was all aflame and the towering peaks of
the neighboring Untersberg<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> were transfused as with
a golden glory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A beautiful evening,&rdquo; said Adlgasser, &ldquo;but, if
I mistake not, still more beautiful days will follow
it. God has given you a son, Mozart, and, as I
believe, a wonder child. Let us hope he will fill
the whole world with the light of his genius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let us so hope, but let us put our trust in
the help of the Almighty,&rdquo; said Father Mozart,
with much emotion. &ldquo;Everything shall be done,
so far as lies in my power, that will make this child
a great artist.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>By this time they had reached the city, where
their ways separated. They parted with a hearty
handshake, and each betook himself to his own
house. Father Mozart&rsquo;s way led him straight to
the cradle of his boy. The little one was peacefully
sleeping. He gently kissed him, and in a silent
prayer commended him to the protection of the
Lord. Then he went to his own room, took his
violin, and in sweetest tones gave melodious expression
to the happiness of his heart. That was
always his way when his emotions were aroused.
He had not played so beautifully for a long, long
time as on that evening; perhaps he never played
so beautifully in his life. Never before, indeed,
had there been such a joyous and satisfactory inducement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Little Virtuoso</span></h2>
<p>The little Mozart was christened Johann
Chrysostom Wolfgang Amadeus,<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> and
was called by his parents and his sister
Nannie,<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> &ldquo;Wolfgangerl,&rdquo; at least as long
as he wore children&rsquo;s shoes. On the fourteenth of
December, 1759, he being then three years and ten
months old, a pleasant family feast was given by the
relatives and friends of the sincerely and heartily
beloved Father Mozart, in honor of his fortieth
birthday. On that day the solicitous mother had
been actively engaged making preparations since
early morning, and although her little eight-year-old
daughter Nannie was an industrious helper,
there still remained so much to be done that she
could pay little or no attention to Wolfgang, who
consequently passed away the time until noon just
as he pleased. Dressed in his best clothes, the little
fellow sat at the window, quietly looking out into
the street, and softly repeating, over and over again,
the words of a little poem, with which, in childish
festive fashion, he intended to welcome his father
when he came home from his duties at noon. A
friend of the family had written the verses, and
Nannie and his mother had recited them to him so
often that he knew them by heart. Suddenly, however,
the little fellow stopped; his handsome, good-natured
face was illumined with a smile, and he
sprang up and knocked sharply on the window-pane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Andreas,&rdquo; he loudly cried; &ldquo;Andreas,
come in a little while. I am all alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door was immediately opened, and a boy of
Wolfgang&rsquo;s age, Andreas Schachtner,<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> his devoted
playmate, entered the room with a look of astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Wolfgang, how is it you are so nicely
dressed?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;This is not Sunday, nor a
feast day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, but it is a birthday,&rdquo; replied little Wolfgang,
with an air of importance,&mdash;&ldquo;father&rsquo;s birthday.
We are going to have cake and wine, Andreas!
Just think how good they will taste!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to you; but what does it matter to me?&rdquo;
said Andreas, trying to keep the tears back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what are you crying for?&rdquo; replied Wolfgang,
quickly, and with affectionate impulsiveness.
&ldquo;Do you think I would not share a piece of cake
with you and let you drink out of my glass? Oh,
no, I am not so mean as that! So don&rsquo;t mind;
and let us play a little while together, that the time
may pass more quickly until noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what shall we play? It&rsquo;s too cold to go
out doors, Wolfgangerl,&rdquo; said Andreas, appeased at
once by the prospect of having some cake and
wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us stay in and turn somersaults,&rdquo; cried
Wolfgang. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s great fun, if you don&rsquo;t fall on
your nose.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Andreas made no objection, and with loud and
merry shouts of laughter the two little fellows ran
about, turned somersaults, wrestled, and tumbled
around on the sand-strewn floor, Wolfgang utterly
forgetting that he was dressed in his best clothes.
Their uproar rang through the house, and at last
reached his mother&rsquo;s ears. In alarm she hastened
to ascertain the cause of the tumult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at yourself, Wolfgangerl, you naughty
child!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as she entered the room and
found the little fellows covered with dust and sand
from head to foot. &ldquo;What have you been doing?
How you have soiled your clothes! What if
your father should see you now! Oh, you bad,
bad child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Wolfgang stood amazed, and looked confusedly,
now at his mother, now at the sorry figure
he presented. Shame and sorrow struggled in his
childish face, and at last tears rolled down his flushed
cheeks. &ldquo;Oh, darling mother,&rdquo; he suddenly exclaimed,
rushing to her with outstretched arms,
&ldquo;Oh, my darling mother, do not be angry! We
have only turned a few somersaults, but we will not
do it again. We will be real nice, only don&rsquo;t be
angry with me, dear mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good woman could not resist the little one&rsquo;s
appeal. Displeasure vanished from her face, and
she gently stroked her little son&rsquo;s blond locks.
&ldquo;You are indeed a harum-scarum,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;and
see, your hair too is full of sand. Well, we will overlook
it this time, but if you are naughty again
to-day, you shall have neither cake nor wine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I will be good, perfectly good,&rdquo; replied
Wolfgang, stroking, pressing, and kissing his mother&rsquo;s
hand in a coaxing way. &ldquo;Please forgive me,
and be nice to me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good mother bent over her little one and
embraced him with maternal tenderness. Wolfgang
was soothed and contented. Then his mother
brushed him clean, put his hair and dress in order,
and looked upon him with evident pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it is all right again,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but there
must be no more foolishness, Wolfgangerl, or your
father will be angry. Don&rsquo;t you know that these
fine clothes cost a good deal of money, and that your
father has to work very hard to earn it? So you
must be a good child, and see that you do not soil or
spoil them. Will you not do so, naughty little one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly I will, for I love my father so
dearly that I would not do anything to trouble
him for all the world,&rdquo; the boy replied, and in such
a tone of sincerity that his mother was satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I will leave you alone again,&rdquo; said
she; &ldquo;but what will you do next, if you are not
going to turn somersaults any more?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know, dear mother,&rdquo; he at once replied;
&ldquo;we will play soldiers, and tramp around the room,
and I will play a nice march.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know your march will be fine,&rdquo; said Frau
Mozart, smiling. &ldquo;I wish I could hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can, right off,&rdquo; replied the little fellow.
&ldquo;Attention, Andreas! In position&mdash;so&mdash;now,
forward march.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andreas obeyed. Wolfgang stationed himself by
his side, held both hands to his mouth as if he had
a trumpet in them, and then began playing, or rather
singing, a charming march, in such correct time that
his mother was completely surprised. The two
children marched exultantly around the room, as
well satisfied as if all the world were watching
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right now,&rdquo; at last said his mother.
&ldquo;Now, after this, be good children, and each
of you shall have a big piece of the birthday
cake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words she graciously nodded to the
children and went away. Wolfgang and Andreas
marched and trumpeted for some time. At last
Wolfgang&rsquo;s voice gave out and Andreas complained
that his legs were tired. &ldquo;This is enough for now,&rdquo;
he said to Wolfgang, wiping the sweat from his
forehead. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t march any longer, it is so
warm.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we will play schoolmaster,&rdquo; said Wolfgang
in great glee. &ldquo;You sit there on the stool,
for you are the pupil and I am the teacher. Now
pay attention, for I am going to give you some examples
on the blackboard. There is some chalk in
the drawer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Andreas comfortably seated himself, Wolfgang
took a big piece of chalk and began scribbling
upon the floor and walls as earnestly as if he really
were executing a task of the utmost importance.
They were not actual figures, for he did not yet
know how to make them, but rather meaningless
hieroglyphics, which soon made the polished boards
and the walls of the room look as if a dozen white-footed
crows had been hopping over them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolfgang, you naughty boy, what nonsense is
this?&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed a childish voice. Nannie,
Wolfgang&rsquo;s sister, stood in the doorway, regarding
with astonishment the disfigured boards and
walls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what is the matter, Nannerl? We are
only playing school, and having some lessons in
arithmetic,&rdquo; replied Wolfgang, looking at his sister
in the most innocent manner and with an expression
of absolute delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you entirely forget that mother and I
have been toiling since early this morning to get
things clean and in good order,&rdquo; said Nannie, beginning
to cry. &ldquo;Now we must begin all over
again, and there is no one more to blame for it than
you. You are a naughty, naughty child. Go away;
I do not wish to see you any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When little Wolfgang saw tears glistening in his
sister&rsquo;s eyes and noticed her manifest grief, it came
over him all at once that he had behaved improperly.
Thoroughly surprised, he was at her side in an instant.
He gently pulled at her dress and softly
said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, dear Nannerl, I beg of you.
Little Wolfgang has been naughty, but he will not
do so again. Only don&rsquo;t be angry, my dear, darling
Nannerl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He begged so piteously, appeared so thoroughly
contrite, and raised his little clasped hands so imploringly
to his sister, that she could not remain
offended. She turned a kindly face to him, and
Wolfgang was not slow in noticing it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now you are again my good Nannerl, and you
have forgiven me,&rdquo; he loudly exclaimed, as he put
up his mouth to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this shall be overlooked,&rdquo; said his sister,
as she lovingly kissed her brother&rsquo;s little lips, &ldquo;but
don&rsquo;t make any more trouble. I will quickly rub
it all out, so that mother will never know how
naughty you have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Wolfgang sat quietly by while Nannie
rubbed out the chalk-marks with nimble hands.
In a few minutes everything was again clean and orderly,
and Wolfgang embraced her, and over and
over again called her his &ldquo;dear, good Nannerl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a good-for-nothing,&rdquo; she replied, half
laughing, half angry, &ldquo;but I cannot help being
good to you because you have a good heart; but
don&rsquo;t play any more of your silly tricks, for your
father will soon be here, and then you must recite
your little piece. Can you do it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, every line of it,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I
guess papa will be astonished for once. Listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant the house door opened, men&rsquo;s
voices were heard in the hall, and soon Vice Chapelmaster
Leopold Mozart entered with some of his
friends. Wolfgang joyously flew to him and embraced
him. &ldquo;God greet you, father,&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;I congratulate you a thousand times on your
birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, thank you, my little one,&rdquo; replied
Father Mozart, kissing him. &ldquo;Do you love your
father very much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; said Wolfgang, looking at him with
beaming eyes, &ldquo;I love you very, very much, and,
do you know, after the dear God comes my dear,
good papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This greatly pleases me, little fellow. Keep
both in your heart as long as you live and all will be
well with you,&rdquo; said Father Mozart, with great emotion,
as he laid his hand in blessing upon the child&rsquo;s
curly head. The mother and sister also entered
and offered their congratulations. While this was
going on little Wolfgang mounted the stool, struck
an attitude, and recited his little address, not only
correctly and in good voice, but with heartfelt emotion.
It ran thus:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;This day my heart exults with joy,</p>
<p class="t0">This day that sweetest welcome brings;</p>
<p class="t0">It greets me in my own young day,</p>
<p class="t0">And to my youthful heart it sings:</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;I bring both happiness and blessing.</p>
<p class="t0">Yes, happiness is truly mine,</p>
<p class="t0">Oh, day so rare, oh, day so fine;</p>
<p class="t0">My father&rsquo;s life, so true, so strong,</p>
<p class="t0">And God&rsquo;s own love to me belong;</p>
<p class="t0">His counsel wise I will obey,</p>
<p class="t0">Hold to the right, take virtue&rsquo;s way;</p>
<p class="t0">Yes, father, I am thine my whole life long,</p>
<p class="t0">My heart is yours;&rsquo; so ends my song.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>A loud &ldquo;brava&rdquo; followed the little poem, which
had truly come from his heart, and all complimented
Wolfgang because he had acquitted himself so well.
Tears stood in his mother&rsquo;s eyes, and even the men
displayed emotion, as if they realized that an unusual
inspiration was already manifesting itself in
the little one. Wolfgang, however, was somewhat
disconcerted by the serious mood of the company.
Jumping down from his stool, he loudly shouted,
&ldquo;Let us go to the table, for I am hungry, and
mamma has promised me a glass of wine and a big
piece of cake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>All laughed and followed the little fellow into
an adjoining room, where the table was spread,
handsomely decorated with flowers and growing
plants. They seated themselves, and more than an
hour passed in lively conversation and general intercourse.
They were tried and true friends. What
they said came truthfully and sincerely from the
heart. The afternoon called the father to his duties,
for he would not neglect them, even on his birthday,
and his guests left at the same time. Toward
evening, however, he returned, contented and pleased
after a day&rsquo;s duties well performed. &ldquo;I have been
very happy to-day, mother,&rdquo; he said to his wife,
as he affectionately embraced her. &ldquo;I am going
to begin to-day what I have contemplated for
some time, namely, giving piano lessons to our
Nannerl. Come here, child. You shall have one
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And give me one too, papa,&rdquo; said Wolfgang,
eagerly. &ldquo;You will find I can do just as well as
Nannerl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you silly boy, you can hardly stretch
four keys with your little fingers,&rdquo; said his father,
laughing. &ldquo;Play and laugh with your comrades all
you will, and never mind the piano.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Thus severely admonished, Wolfgang retired to
a corner of the room with a sorrowful face. Nannie
seated herself at the piano, and Father Mozart
began the lesson. It had not continued long before
Wolfgang became restless. He stole nearer and
nearer, on tiptoe, until he was behind his father&rsquo;s
chair, where he listened intently to his words and
instructions. There he remained until the lesson
was over. Nannie left for the kitchen, to help
her mother to get supper. Father Mozart began
reading a book in his armchair. Wolfgang stood
at the piano, thoughtfully looking at the keys.
After a little, and apparently unconscious of what
he was doing, he placed his hands on the keyboard
and began striking thirds as he had just
seen his sister do. At the sound of the instrument
his countenance lit up, his eyes glowed, and
utterly absorbed by the passion of music he forgot
all else.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Father Mozart at first paid no notice to his son&rsquo;s
playing. Gradually, however, as the tones grew
fuller and stronger, he became attentive, laid aside
the book he had been reading, and watched little
Wolfgang with constantly increasing astonishment.
He listened eagerly, and was more and more delighted
when he found that Wolfgang repeated accurately
and without a slip the little exercise which he had
played over shortly before to Nannie. Tears of
joy stood in his eyes. He arose, and going to
Wolfgang, folded him in his arms and, overcome
by his emotions, exclaimed: &ldquo;Wolfgang, my heart&rsquo;s
own little one, surely, and beyond all question, you
are already a true musician.&rdquo; Then he called the
mother and sister and told them the good news,
and Wolfgang had to repeat the little pieces,
which he did excellently. All were delighted.
His mother embraced and kissed him, his sister
joyfully clapped her hands, and his father looked
on with beaming face. Little Wolfgang alone remained
calm, and wondered that his playing caused
such a commotion. &ldquo;Why, that is nothing,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I have known all that from the first; but
you will see, papa, that I shall soon know far more
than this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God grant it. For my part, I have no further
doubt of it,&rdquo; said his father, deeply moved. &ldquo;I will
not fail to teach you all that I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile bedtime had come, and little Wolfgang
was tired. This time his father himself put
him to bed, said the evening prayer as his mother
was accustomed to do, and tucked him up nice and
warm. It was hardly done before the little fellow
was sound asleep, but Father Mozart knelt a while
at the bedside, and raised his heart and soul to the
Eternal Father in heaven.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, my God,&rdquo; he silently prayed. &ldquo;Thou
hast given me a rare and beautiful flower. Give
me also strength and perseverance, that I may tend
it and bring it to its perfect blossoming, for thy
honor and my happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God heard the prayer. It rose to His throne in
heaven, found favor in His eyes, and was granted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">In the Wide World</span></h2>
<p>It was the height of summer. The Archbishop
of Salzburg had ordered his chapel to
the neighboring Ch&acirc;teau of Heilbronn to entertain
a number of invited guests with table
music, and had sent them on in advance without
any instructions, in his usually provoking and imperious
manner. Although the members of his
chapel were distinguished artists, he had no more
respect for them, and particularly for Vice Chapelmaster
Mozart, than for the dust under his feet, and
treated them no better, sometimes,&mdash;indeed even
worse,&mdash;than the lowest of his lackeys. Upon this
occasion he several times displayed his contempt
for them in a manner so utterly devoid of decency
that Father Mozart resented it, and in depressed
spirits returned to Salzburg on foot. Naturally his
artistic pride rebelled against such treatment; but
when tempted, as he often was, to break the galling
fetters of this servitude, consideration for his family
forced him to be patient, and to endure it uncomplainingly.
The trifling compensation which he annually
received for his service as vice chapelmaster
was not sufficient to relieve himself and family from
anxiety; but even these few hundred guldens he
could not spare, except at the risk of impoverishment,
and as the small sums received from private
instruction were not large enough to support the
family, he was forced to submit to this indignity,
and conceal his resentment as best he could, by the
exercise of the strongest self-control.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>As he proceeded along the shaded avenue to
Salzburg, absorbed in mournful contemplation, and
vainly seeking to calm his disturbed spirit, a friend
and patron unexpectedly met him. He had been
attached to Mozart for a long time, because he knew
his worth and thoroughly appreciated his faithfulness
and industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day, my dear Mozart,&rdquo; he cordially said.
&ldquo;Where are you going? And why are you so
troubled? I did not suppose a good musician
and a master of art like you could ever be out of
humor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you only knew, Count von Herbenstein,&rdquo;
replied Mozart, pleasantly surprised by his patron&rsquo;s
greeting. &ldquo;The shoe often pinches us poor musicians
in more than one place, and sometimes so
hard that the best disposition cannot stand it. You
were there this very day, Herr Count, when the
Archbishop treated us so shabbily. Did he not
insult us before all the guests by calling us a &lsquo;dissolute
rabble,&rsquo; &lsquo;frivolous fellows,&rsquo; and &lsquo;a good-for-nothing
pack&rsquo;? I could have sunk into the earth
for shame. What must these distinguished strangers
have thought of us when we were treated in such
manner by our own master? Really, sometimes I
would rather be a wood-chopper or a boot-black
than the Archbishop&rsquo;s vice chapelmaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Restrain yourself, dear Mozart,&rdquo; said Count
Herbenstein, gently placing his hand on the vice
chapelmaster&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;We all know the Archbishop,
and what to expect from him. Believe me,
you are not lowered in our estimation by his aspersions.
Do not let them disturb you. Seek consolation
in your beautiful art. I know that you are a
great violin virtuoso, and that you have written a
famous &lsquo;Violin School.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> I have thought for some
time of asking you to write me some nice chamber
music, for which I will advance you twenty-five
ducats.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are too generous, Herr Count,&rdquo; replied
Mozart, delightedly. &ldquo;It will be a welcome
addition to my meagre income, and I will thankfully
undertake your kind commission. It will help
to pay the expenses of a journey to Vienna, which I
am going to make as soon as possible with my
Wolfgang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! so you are going with your little son to
Vienna,&rdquo; said Count Herbenstein. The conversation
now took a new turn. &ldquo;Is it really true that
your little Wolfgang is such an extraordinary genius
as I hear on all sides?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whenever his son was mentioned, Father Mozart
was aflame with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Certainly it is, Herr
Count,&rdquo; he replied, excitedly. &ldquo;I cannot say too
much for that child. It is perfectly astonishing
the progress Wolfgang has made in such short
time. It absolutely surprises me. Just think of
it, notwithstanding his hands are so little, he already
plays the piano finely; better, indeed, than his
sister, who is older than he, and who is not without
talent herself. When he has been to a concert, he
can play every piece by memory.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is really extraordinary,&rdquo; said the Count.
&ldquo;And does he actually play intelligently and correctly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correctly and sometimes brilliantly,&rdquo; answered
Father Mozart. &ldquo;He learns with incredible facility.
It hardly takes him half an hour to learn a minuet
or any other small concert piece, and play it clearly
and neatly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible! Impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed the Count.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not believe me, Herr Count?&rdquo; said
Father Mozart. &ldquo;If you will give me the honor
of your company and go home with me, you shall
have proof of my statements, and see for yourself
that I have not exaggerated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count consented to go, for he was really
curious to see the little Wolfgang. &ldquo;All right,
dear friend, I will go with you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your
Wolfgang must be a marvellous little fellow if all
they say of him is true.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>They soon reached the house and entered.
They came at an opportune time, for an interesting
spectacle greeted them. Little Wolfgang was
seated at his father&rsquo;s desk, writing upon a sheet of
paper with such eagerness that he did not notice
their entrance. The vice chapelmaster beckoned to
the Count to approach nearer, and both looked over
the boy&rsquo;s shoulders. It was a singular looking paper.
Half of it was covered with notes, and smudged over
with blots, which in his haste he had wiped out with
his hand, leaving dingy curves, resembling big and
little comets, in the midst of which the notes looked
like black stars. The little fellow kept on writing,
not in the least minding when he jabbed his pen to
the bottom of the inkstand and blotted his paper
anew. He would coolly wipe it off with the palm of
his hand as before, and go on writing until the paper
was covered with notes and blots from top to bottom.
All at once he jumped up and gleefully clapped his
hands when he saw his father and the Count. His
eyes shone with unusual lustre, his cheeks glowed,
and he was evidently deeply excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing there, Wolfgangerl?&rdquo;
asked his father. &ldquo;Have you been spoiling more
paper with your scribbling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not spoiling it, dearest father,&rdquo; replied the
boy, flourishing the paper exultantly in the air.
&ldquo;See, I am writing a concerto<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> on it. The first
part is all done. Look at it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it must be fine stuff you have been scrawling,
you silly little fellow,&rdquo; said his father, laughing.
He took the paper and at first only hastily glanced
at it, but suddenly his gaze was riveted upon it, and
the utmost astonishment was manifest in his countenance.
At last he looked up and addressed the
Count. &ldquo;Truly, this is a correct concerto, Herr
Count,&rdquo; he said exultantly, while tears of delight
and surprise stood in his eyes. &ldquo;It is written in
accordance with the rules of the art, only it is too
difficult for any one to play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only a concerto,&rdquo; replied little Wolfgang.
&ldquo;It must be practised some time before one can play
it; but after all, it is not so difficult as you think. I
will show you how it goes on the piano, papa.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>The little fellow, barely five years old, eagerly ran
to the piano and began playing with enthusiasm.
Of course he hesitated a little at first, and the
more difficult passages did not go well at the first
trial; but it was not long before he had it so completely
in hand that the working up of the themes
was clearly apparent. Father Mozart stood speechless
with rapture. Count Herbenstein was overcome
with astonishment, and both contemplated the
boy with something like reverence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herr Vice Chapelmaster,&rdquo; at last said Count
Herbenstein, &ldquo;I congratulate you from the bottom
of my heart. If God spare your child&rsquo;s life, he will
one day be a great artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he will be a great artist,&rdquo; repeated Father
Mozart, in the exuberance of his joy, as he took
little Wolfgang in his arms and kissed him. &ldquo;If
Heaven will keep him safe and well, I will never
again complain of anything, or envy the power and
greatness of the Archbishop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With such a treasure as this you will have
no occasion to do so,&rdquo; said the Count, pointing to
Wolfgang. &ldquo;And now, God keep you. May we
have a speedy and happy reunion.&rdquo; He shook
hands heartily with Father Mozart, kissed little
Wolfgang, and went away to tell his friends what
wonderful things he had seen at the vice chapelmaster&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>From this time on Father Mozart took unusual
pains with the instruction of his children, particularly
with Wolfgang. The result was so satisfactory
that before his son had finished his sixth year he
decided to make a concert tour with him and his
sister, introduce the two little artists to the great
world, and challenge its admiration. In reality, he
ran no risk. Success was assured in advance, for
Wolfgang&rsquo;s ability increased with such wonderful
rapidity as to astonish even his father, who was by
no means easily satisfied, but on the contrary very
exacting. The little man not only displayed extraordinary
facility and dexterity in piano playing, but
he also composed a large number of pretty pieces,
which he played over to his father, who wrote them
out.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> He no longer cared for anything but his
loved music. He took no part in the sports of
children of his age after his father began his instruction.
He also displayed unusual interest in the
study of mathematics, and was completely absorbed
in melody and harmony.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Preparations for the journey were soon made, and
little Mozart was delighted with the prospect. He
had not the slightest fear of appearing before strangers
in public. On the contrary, he was eager to
surprise them with his rare talent. Their first visit
was to Vienna, where Father Mozart hoped to find
patrons and friends who could secure their presentation
at the royal court. They made the journey
by way of Linz,<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> and thence by the regular passenger
boat down the Danube. He took the whole family
with him, and as all were buoyant with hope, the
journey was a pleasant one. Wolfgang particularly
enjoyed himself because of his open and trusting
disposition. He mingled freely in his lively way
with the passengers, chatted with each and every
one, was fondled and caressed by all, and even
made friends with the rough crew by his merry
antics.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>On the way they reached the little village of Ipo,
on the Danube, where the vessel remained a short
time, as some of the passengers wished to visit a
monastery in the vicinity. Father Mozart and his
family also went there. It was solitary, silent, and
solemn in the great auditorium of the church, for
the monks were at dinner. Thoughtful and awestruck,
Wolfgang looked at the lofty building, its
tall, slender columns and brilliantly stained windows,
until at last his gaze rested upon a magnificent organ.
His eyes flashed.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Explain the pedals to me, papa,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I
should like to see if I can play the organ.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>His father complied, and Wolfgang listened attentively
until he understood the mechanism of the instrument,
then he requested a servitor of the church
to blow for him, pushed the organ bench to one side,
and, standing by the pedals, trod them and struck
the keys as correctly as if he had practised for
months. The music, continually growing more
powerful and majestic, rolled in grand and solemn
volume through the great hall of the church, and
melody followed melody in the consecrated solitude.
The monks in the refectory near by laid down knife
and fork and, marvelling greatly, entered the church.
The brother organist was among them, and gazed at
his organ as if terror-stricken. It had never been
played like this before. Who could it be letting
loose such a flood of music from those rigid pipes?
The monks looked at each other with blanched faces.
The organ seemed to be playing itself, for the little
performer could not be seen from below. Some of
the brothers crossed themselves in fear. Some whispered,
&ldquo;Satan himself is playing,&rdquo; while others said,
&ldquo;This is a miracle. It has never happened before.&rdquo;
At last some of them mustered up courage, and with
the prior at their head, went up into the organ-loft,
where they stood transfixed with astonishment at
sight of the child, who was still playing as if inspired,
and did not observe them until his father aroused
him from his spell. Then all gathered about him,
praising and admiring him. The brother organist,
pale with excitement, laid his trembling hand upon
the boy&rsquo;s head and blessed him, saying, &ldquo;Thou wilt
yet accomplish great things for the honor of God,
and may God be with thee in all thy ways as thy
strong protector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Wolfgang looked about him in surprise,
and pleasantly smiled as if he had done nothing to
occasion such a demonstration. His power was indeed
great, but he was not in the least aware that he
possessed it.</p>
<p>The influence of this power was again manifested
before the family reached Vienna,&mdash;this time in an
accidental and somewhat amusing manner. Before
the passengers were allowed to go into the city their
baggage was searched by a custom-house official for
articles liable to duty. This occasioned considerable
delay as well as vexation. Little Wolfgang was impatient
over it, and in his saucy, impetuous manner
accosted one of the higher officials, and boldly addressed
him. &ldquo;Dear Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;why do you
open the trunks and bags of these people and search
them? Don&rsquo;t you know you are hindering them
from going on their way?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, youngster, that is our duty,&rdquo; replied the
official, laughing. &ldquo;But what are you in search of
in our beautiful Kaiser city?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I? I have come here to play the piano,&rdquo; said
Wolfgang, with an air of importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You! You little snip! You play the piano!&rdquo;
said the official. &ldquo;Much you can do with those
little claws! Go ahead, but look out that they don&rsquo;t
laugh at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will see whether any one dares to laugh at
me,&rdquo; said Wolfgang, angrily. &ldquo;See, there is our
piano which we brought with us from Salzburg,
packed in that big box. If it were only open I
would soon show you whether I can play the piano
or not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>The official was curious to hear him, for the little
fellow spoke so confidently that he could hardly
doubt him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we will let you try,&rdquo; said he, as he
ordered a workman to unpack the box. Wolfgang
opened the piano, seated himself at it, and played
some lively dances with his usual skill. The
official opened his eyes in astonishment, and vigorously
applauded him. All those in the custom
house&mdash;officials, passengers, and servants&mdash;crowded
around Wolfgang, and listened with delight to the
melodies which he elicited from the keys with his
&ldquo;little claws.&rdquo; Then with a smile he stopped and
turned to the official. &ldquo;Now do I know anything
about piano playing?&rdquo; said he, roguishly. &ldquo;You
can laugh at me, sir, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, youngster,&rdquo; replied the delighted official,
as he stroked the boy&rsquo;s red cheeks; &ldquo;you are truly
a little master musician. Those who hear you will
not laugh at you. With thanks to you and your
father for your beautiful playing, we will soon discharge
you, so that you may go to your hotel and
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>It was done at once. The official performed his
duty in the most courteous and agreeable manner,
and Father Mozart and his family were soon
comfortably ensconced in their hotel, while the other
passengers had to wait in the custom house for their
permits.</p>
<p>Such was the influence of his great skill. As
Amphion, according to the legend, set the rocks to
dancing, so little Wolfgang moved the usually flinty
heart of the customs official until it became his willing
servant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">At the Imperial Court</span></h2>
<p>The reputation of the family had preceded
them, and greatly to their advantage, for
the nobility of Vienna were enthusiastically
interested in them. They received
almost daily invitations to entertainments, where
Wolfgang&rsquo;s extraordinary skill created the utmost
astonishment. Count Palssy, in particular, who
had heard Wolfgang play in Linz, and Countess
Sinzendorf took them under their protection, introduced
them to the homes of the best families,
and at last procured the special invitation to Court
which Father Mozart had so long hoped and waited
for. Wolfgang himself was still too little and childish
to appreciate the high honor paid him. He was
simply pleased at the opportunity he would have to
see the splendors of the Court. As to the playing,
he relied upon his skill and courage, which had
never yet failed him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Presentation day came. At three o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon the royal equipage was at the door, and
Baron von Stauffen, his Majesty&rsquo;s private treasurer,
invited the family to take seats in the elegant state
coach. Little Mozart&rsquo;s heart beat more quickly as
he rode through the streets of the Court quarter.
A few minutes later he was in the ante-chamber of
her Majesty the Empress, waiting the moment
which should reveal to him all the glories of her
Court. That moment quickly came. The folding
doors of the music hall were thrown open. Her
Majesty&rsquo;s first gentleman in waiting beckoned to the
family to come forward, and a moment later they were
in the presence of the renowned Empress, Maria
Theresa, and her noble consort, Francis the First,
the royal household standing in the background.</p>
<p>Wolfgang had never seen such splendor before.
He was in a rich and brilliantly decorated hall, with
silken tapestries, tall mirrors in glistening gold
frames, heavy silken curtains, and polished inlaid
floor. In a chair a little above the rest, over which
glistened a golden crown, sat a majestic woman&mdash;the
Empress. At her side stood the princes and
princesses, and a little farther on the Emperor,
leaning against a beautiful piano.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Wolfgang cast hardly more than a fleeting glance
at the splendor all about him. His gaze was fixed
upon the Empress, whom he regarded for some
time with childish love and reverence. The little
archduchess, Marie Antoinette, afterwards the unhappy
spouse of Louis the Sixteenth of France, with
her beautiful curly head resting upon her mother&rsquo;s
arm, watched Wolfgang with curious eyes. After
a little the Emperor advanced to Wolfgang and led
him to the Empress, who outstretched both hands
with true maternal tenderness, and greeted him with
a gracious smile. Although forty-five years of age
at this time, she was still a very beautiful woman,
and one whose fascinating manners could not help
making a deep impression upon the susceptible
young artist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you are the little piano-player of whom
we have heard so much,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Wolfgang, as naturally and as
unembarrassed as if he were talking with his own
mother. &ldquo;It is true I am only a child, but notwithstanding
that I can play the piano, as I shall be
very glad to prove to the Lady Empress.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>The easy and familiar manner in which Wolfgang
addressed the august lady nearly paralyzed the
courtiers, who were accustomed to the most rigid
etiquette, but the Empress was not in the least
offended with his childish frankness; on the other
hand, she appeared pleased with this sincere, cordial,
and informal artist nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, child,&rdquo; she kindly said; &ldquo;but are
you so sure of all this? I warn you there are
several persons behind us who know a great deal
about music, and they will criticise you pretty
severely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those there?&rdquo; replied Wolfgang, turning a
little to one side and casting a sharp glance at the
brilliant assemblage. &ldquo;Those?&rdquo; he repeated, shaking
his head contemptuously. &ldquo;No, Lady Empress,
begging your pardon, they do not look as if they
were good musicians. Certainly not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not, you saucy boy?&rdquo; said the Empress,
restraining a smile with some difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they don&rsquo;t show any signs of it, Your
Majesty. They are altogether too stiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this na&iuml;ve reply, which nearly threw the whole
royal train into a panic, Maria Theresa could no
longer restrain herself. She laughed loudly, and as
a matter of etiquette her attendants had to laugh
also, though they were not particularly flattered at
the low estimate the little virtuoso had placed upon
their musical ability.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you are truly a saucy child,&rdquo; said the
Empress, still laughing, as she patted Wolfgang&rsquo;s
cheeks with her white hands. &ldquo;Really, Franz, he
is a cunning little imp and ought to make a diplomat
or a statesman, if physiognomy counts for
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly does not lack for courage,&rdquo; said
the Emperor, smiling and turning to the Empress,
who had addressed her last remark to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, let us keep him here,&rdquo; said the little
Marie Antoinette, raising her head and looking at
the Empress with her large, kindly eyes. &ldquo;I like
him very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there would be one advantage in keeping
him,&rdquo; replied the Empress, good-naturedly. &ldquo;You
could at least learn from him how to play the piano
properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he play so very well?&rdquo; said the little
princess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magnificently, I hear from all sides,&rdquo; replied
the Empress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then why may we not hear him right away?
I am really very curious about it,&rdquo; said Marie
Antoinette, looking at Wolfgang as if challenging
him to play.</p>
<p>Wolfgang&rsquo;s artistic pride was aroused, for there
was something in the manner of the little princess
that impelled him to do the best he could. With
kindling eyes he looked about him, and stepped up
to the piano to give them an example of his skill.
The Emperor, however, interposed. &ldquo;Hold, little
man,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You have just asserted that none
of these ladies and gentlemen know enough to
judge of your playing&mdash;who then shall be the
umpire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With scarcely an instant&rsquo;s hesitation Wolfgang
replied, &ldquo;Oh, I know an excellent one,&mdash;Herr
Wagenseil,<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> the Empress&rsquo;s music teacher. He
understands music. If convenient, send for him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right; it shall be done,&rdquo; said the Emperor,
who at once ordered a servant to summon that
famous composer and pianist. In the meantime
Wolfgang went to his sister, took her by the hand,
and led her to the Empress without any ceremony.
&ldquo;See, Your Majesty,&rdquo; said he, introducing her, &ldquo;this
is Nannerl, my sister. She plays as well as I do.&rdquo;
The Empress laughed heartily at the odd ways of
the little fellow, addressed a few kind words to
Nannie, and then beckoned to Father Mozart, with
whom she conversed most affably about the children
and music. In the meantime Wolfgang and
Nannie chatted with the princes and princesses, and
Wolfgang was so loud in his praises of his sister
that it attracted Maria Theresa&rsquo;s notice. &ldquo;Look
here, little one,&rdquo; she said, stretching her hands out
to him as before, &ldquo;do you really love your Nannerl
so very much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Lady Empress,&rdquo; eagerly replied Wolfgang,
pressing her Majesty&rsquo;s hand with childlike
freedom. &ldquo;Of course I love her, but I also love
you, for you please me very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is extremely flattering to me,&rdquo; replied the
Empress, &ldquo;but how can you convince me of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By giving you a kiss, thus,&rdquo; he exclaimed; and
before any one could stop him, or prevent such unheard-of
audacity, he sprang into the Empress&rsquo;s lap,
threw both arms around her neck, and kissed her
tenderly and impulsively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>The Empress in her infinite goodness indulged
the boy and laughed, perhaps more heartily than
she had ever done before, at his childish boldness.
The Emperor and the princes and princesses also
laughed until the tears stood in their eyes, and the
others, following the example of their superiors,
dutifully simpered, though some of these stiff ladies
and gentlemen nearly fainted away in their amazement
at the temerity of this common lad. Such an
occurrence had never before been known at the royal
court in their recollection.</p>
<p>At last Herr Wagenseil came, and the Emperor,
after introducing them, requested Wolfgang to play.
He was all ready, kissed the Emperor&rsquo;s hand, and
hurried to the piano. &ldquo;I am glad you are here,&rdquo;
he said to Herr Wagenseil. &ldquo;I will play a concerto
of yours, and would like to have you turn the leaves
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herr Wagenseil came forward with a smile, and
after rapidly running over a few passages, Wolfgang
played the concerto. His performance took every
one by surprise. Whatever their expectations,
Wolfgang was resolved to surpass them. He played
with a fire and intelligence which astonished all.
It grew more and more quiet. The Emperor, the
Empress, the princes and princesses, and the rest
of the company kept their eyes fixed upon the little
virtuoso, and Herr Wagenseil&rsquo;s manner betrayed
his extreme surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>When the concerto was finished, and Wolfgang
had played the last note, it was naturally supposed
he would stop, but instead of doing so, he continued
playing, taking a theme from the concerto and
improvising upon it beautifully for nearly a quarter
of an hour. He drew from the instrument expressions
of sorrow and joy, pain and ecstasy, melancholy
and divine happiness. A stream of richest
melodies seemed to gush from under his hands as
the clear, silvery brook leaps from the rocks. All
listened as if entranced, until he closed with a brilliant
cadenza, and then sprang from his seat with
flashing eyes.</p>
<p>For some time deep silence followed his playing.
Then the Empress expressed her great delight by applause.
All present imitated her, and overwhelmed
the little player with compliments. Even the quiet
and sedate Herr Wagenseil frankly expressed his
surprise. Wolfgang calmly accepted the ovation,
keeping his delighted gaze upon the Empress, and
said, &ldquo;Now, your Majesty, have I not done my
work well?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the exalted sovereign; &ldquo;notwithstanding
your youth, you are already a great musician,
whom we must admire. We heartily wish
that your skill may increase with your years,
until at last you reach the very summit of your
art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With divine help, Lady Empress,&rdquo; replied the
happy Wolfgang, &ldquo;which will not fail me, I shall
strive to deserve your praise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nannie also played, revealing surprising skill for
one so young; but in reality she had neither the
intellectual nor the artistic ability of her brother,
and consequently had to be satisfied with less enthusiastic
applause from the audience.</p>
<p>During a pause in the music, the Empress turned
to Father Mozart and said: &ldquo;I sincerely congratulate
you that you have these children. They are a
gift from Heaven, such as is rarely vouchsafed to
man. Educate them well, so that their fine natural
ability may be developed and produce the highest
results.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>While the vice chapelmaster was assuring her
Majesty upon this point, there was a sudden outburst
of merry laughter near her. She turned with
an expression of surprise and displeasure. Her
rising anger, however, was dispelled when the Emperor
came forward and said with a smile: &ldquo;This
Wolfgang is a witty genius. I asked him whom he
considered the greatest musician in the past, and he
replied, &lsquo;The trumpeter who blew down the walls
of Jericho.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Empress could not help laughing at the
droll answer. The Emperor continued: &ldquo;I may
not succeed, but I am going to try to catch him.
Look here, Wolfgang, I acknowledge that you have
played very beautifully, but you have done it with
all ten fingers, and that is not much of a feat. Show
us what you can do with one finger, or with the keyboard
covered, then we can tell whether you really
are a true musician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied Wolfgang. &ldquo;I have never
tried either way, but I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying this, he went to the piano again, and skilfully
executed some very difficult passages with one
finger. Then he covered the keyboard with a cloth
and played some charming little pieces as clearly
and accurately as if he had always practised them
that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a little magician,&rdquo; said the astonished
Emperor, &ldquo;and so skilful that he compels you to
admire him, whether you will or no.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>The audience over, the Mozart family took leave
of the royal family in the most friendly manner.
The Empress gave Wolfgang and Nannie two beautiful
diamond rings and graciously expressed her
satisfaction to Father Mozart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your children have delighted me,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;and I hope we may see them again ere long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Delighted with her condescension, Father Mozart
and the children returned home, and blessed the
day which had been so happy and fortunate for
them. But still greater joy and surprise were in
store. Some days after the presentation the royal
equipage again drove up, and the private treasurer,
Baron Stauffen, brought instructions and gifts from
the Empress. Father Mozart received a hundred
ducats, and each of his children an elegant costume
which had been made for some of the little royal
highnesses. They were also invited by the Baron,
in the name of the Empress, to the imperial table
for that day,&mdash;of course only as spectators, to witness
the pomp and ceremony of a state dinner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;Her Majesty, our exalted Empress, desires that
the children shall appear in these court dresses,&rdquo;
said the Baron, &ldquo;and will send a carriage at six
o&rsquo;clock to bring you all to the castle.&rdquo; Thereupon
he took leave with a stiff bow, for he was an exceedingly
ceremonious person, and in fact was somewhat
displeased that he had to come in contact with these
common persons at the command of his royal
mistress. The Mozart family, however, did not
trouble themselves in the least about his high
mightiness. They were all delighted at the graciousness
of the Empress, who had shown them
so many delicate attentions.</p>
<p>The children were dressed and all ready at half-past
five, and looked charming. Wolfgang strutted
about the room with mock dignity in a lily-colored
waistcoat with broad gold borders, while Nannie
admired her beautifully embroidered white silk dress
in the mirror with expressions of delight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>The carriage drove up at the appointed time, and
a few minutes later the family were in the so-called
&ldquo;golden hall&rdquo; of the castle, where the highest
grandees were to be served at seven tables. The
centre table, a little higher than the others, canopied
with heavy silk and embroidered cloth of gold, was
set apart for the royal family. The others, three
on the right and three on the left, were for the
royal household. They were not yet assembled, so
Wolfgang had time to admire the splendor displayed
in the arrangements. Massive gold and silver
plate, beautiful sets of china, and superb displays
of flowers in vases of the most exquisite designs,
decorated the tables, while numberless candelabra
above shed a brilliant light over all. After a little
the folding doors of an adjoining apartment opened,
and the Empress and Emperor, surrounded by the
prince and princesses of the royal house, entered
the dining hall. All present bowed low before the
majestic sovereign, who slowly advanced, with a
gracious word here and a kindly glance there, and
seated herself at table with her immediate circle. A
shrill fanfare accompanied this ceremony, signifying
also that the rest were to take their places according
to their rank and dignity. They were hardly seated
when the imperial court chapel, which on these
occasions furnished the table music, began playing.
The splendid apartment was filled with exquisite
melody. Wolfgang, who had never heard such
music before, was transported with delight. The
moment it began, he forgot all the magnificence
around him, and was absorbed in its performance
until the last tones softly died away. Then he
awoke with a sigh, as if from a dream, and once
more realized where he was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>At this instant a beautiful voice broke the stillness,
and Wolfgang was surprised to hear his name
spoken. It was the Empress, who was calling and
beckoning to him, much to the astonishment of the
company. Though a little surprised himself, Wolfgang
knew how to behave. He advanced through
the room, carrying his head high, and looking
like a little prince in his new costume, ascended
with firm step to the royal table, and bowing low
to their Majesties, stood a few paces away from the
Empress. &ldquo;What a cavalierish bow the little fellow
makes,&rdquo; said she, with a kindly smile and a slight inclination
of her head, &ldquo;and how well he looks in his
new waistcoat! One would suppose he had always
been at Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, Your Majesty,&rdquo; replied Wolfgang,
boldly, and with the utmost composure, &ldquo;I have seen
Herr Baron Stauffen do that.&rdquo; The Empress could
not help laughing loudly, for Wolfgang had exactly
imitated the stiff, formal manner of the pompous
courtier, even to the swelling out of his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out,&rdquo; said the Empress, warning the boy
with her finger; &ldquo;have a care that the Baron does
not hear you. He may be tempted to upset the
carriage some day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is a matter of no consequence if he does hear
me, Your Majesty,&rdquo; replied Wolfgang, smiling contemptuously,
&ldquo;for nothing could tempt him to
disarrange his ruffles or break his perfume box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence, child,&rdquo; interposed the Empress; &ldquo;you
have a very disrespectful way of talking, which you
must stop. Come nearer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wolfgang obeyed, and the kind Empress gave
him some dainties from her own plate, which he ate
with evident relish. &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the Empress,
&ldquo;now you can go; but I shall expect you after
dinner in my own apartments, where you can play
with my children a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be glad to go, Your Majesty,&rdquo; replied
Wolfgang. &ldquo;Will her little Royal Highness with
the blond hair be there too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean my Marie Antoinette?&rdquo; replied the
Empress. &ldquo;Yes, she will be there, and will be delighted
to see you. Adieu till then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Radiant with joy, Wolfgang bowed again, and
proudly enough marched back to his father&rsquo;s side.
Their Majesties soon arose at the sound of the
trumpets, the signal that dinner was finished. After
affably bowing to the assembled guests, the royal
train left in the same stately way it had entered,
and Chapelmaster Mozart and his family were conducted
by a servant to the ante-chamber of the Empress
to await further orders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>They did not have to wait long. The Empress
was in her dressing-room, and while her maid was
arranging her toilet, Wolfgang and Nannie performed
by turns upon a piano in the waiting-room.
Wolfgang played with an inspired enthusiasm, which
enabled him to overcome the greatest difficulties
with ease. The condescension and maternal kindness
of the noble lady had won his heart, and he
improved this opportunity to express his love and
gratitude by an extraordinary display of his skill.
He continued in this manner until the Empress
herself at last checked his enthusiasm. &ldquo;Enough,
enough, my child,&rdquo; she graciously said. &ldquo;We do
not wish you to make yourself sick by overdoing.
You have again shown us you are a great magician;
now show us that you can be a child among
children.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>The little archduchesses Elizabeth and Marie
Antoinette, who had been listening with delight to
Wolfgang&rsquo;s playing, understood their exalted mother&rsquo;s
hint, and while she engaged in conversation
with Father Mozart and Nannie, they took Wolfgang
by the hand and led him through the magnificent
state rooms which the Empress usually occupied.
They called his attention in the most courteous
manner to the beautiful pictures and furniture,
pointed out remarkable objects, and talked as freely
with him as if they were brother and sisters. An
amusing incident shortly happened, growing out of
the fact that Wolfgang was not as much at home in
the castle as the charming little archduchesses. As
they went along, looking at the statues and pictures
on the walls, Wolfgang did not notice the smoothness
of the inlaid floor, stumbled on a particularly
slippery spot, and fell his whole length. The sight
was amusing; so amusing that Elizabeth could not
refrain from laughing loudly. Marie Antoinette,
on the other hand, did not see the laughable side of
the mishap. She was frightened, and, bending over
Wolfgang, helped him to arise. &ldquo;Poor child, have
you hurt yourself?&rdquo; she said compassionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; replied Wolfgang, giving the pretty
little archduchess a grateful look. &ldquo;No, I do not
think I have, but your Royal Highness, you are so
good and kind to me that I will marry you if you
are willing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Marie Antoinette received the marriage proposal
quite pleasantly, and laughed over it. &ldquo;Let us wait
a bit, little one,&rdquo; she graciously replied, shaking
her curly head. &ldquo;I will ask my mother at once,
and see what she thinks of it.&rdquo; Taking him by
the hand, she went along with him until they were
once more at the Empress&rsquo;s dressing-room. Leading
him to her, she said coquettishly, &ldquo;Mother,
Your Majesty, Wolfgangerl has offered to marry
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Mozart was so shocked at the boy&rsquo;s boldness
that he felt like sinking through the floor.
Maria Theresa looked at the audacious little fellow
with evident pleasure. &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; she said
with a smile, &ldquo;this is a great honor you have offered
us, Wolfgangerl, but may I ask how you came to
make such a flattering proposal to my daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Your Majesty,&rdquo; replied Wolfgang,
modestly and affectionately. &ldquo;I was grateful to
her little Royal Highness for being so kind to me
when I slipped and fell. The Archduchess Elizabeth
laughed at me, but Marie Antoinette helped
me up, and I could not help saying what was uppermost
in my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that is very nice of you, Wolfgangerl,&rdquo; said
the Empress. &ldquo;A thankful heart is worth more
than gold, and we should always be thankful; but
as to this marriage proposal, we must consider it for
a while, you are both so young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Mozart was happy that the event ended
so well, and Wolfgang, perfectly contented, chatted
again with the archduchesses until the family were
kindly dismissed. They returned to their hotel,
happy over the generosity of the good Empress, and
loud in their praises of the powerful sovereign who
had shown them such generosity and affection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Second Violin</span></h2>
<p>Overloaded with attentions, honors,
and distinctions, the Mozart family returned
to Salzburg for a time and resumed
the old quiet life. The journey
to Vienna had been advantageous in many ways.
Father Mozart brought back quite a little sum of
gold; but of still greater value was the reputation
which Wolfgang had so quickly acquired. His talent
had been surprising from his infancy, and now
his first introduction into the great world was in
every way a success. His fame as a rising star of
the first magnitude in the musical firmament was
already beginning to spread all over Europe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Wolfgang, young as he was, appreciated this, and
it was a spur that urged him to attempt the highest
artistic achievements. After the Vienna journey
nothing but music had any attraction for him. He
practised almost incessantly. The customary amusements
of childhood no longer interested him. He
was absorbed in a dominating passion&mdash;the passion
of music.</p>
<p>It was noticeable, as well as curious, that Wolfgang
in his earlier years, notwithstanding his love
for music, had an irresistible aversion to the sound
of metallic instruments, and particularly to the shrill
tone of the trumpet. He revelled in the music of
string instruments and the piano, like a butterfly
among fragrant flowers, but the loud noise of trumpets
and trombones seemed to scare him, and
cause him actual pain. His father, of course, soon
noticed this, and it caused him great anxiety. How
could his son conduct great musical performances,
in which the brasses were indispensable, if he did not
succeed in overcoming this aversion? Remonstrance
and reasoning alike were of no avail. As
soon as he heard a trumpet, even in the distance,
he would either run out of hearing or stop both his
ears. His father decided to adopt vigorous measures,
and one day asked a trumpeter to his room.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, Wolfgangerl, and be sensible,&rdquo; he
said to his son, who was looking at the dreadful
trumpet with a shudder, and was about to take to
his heels as usual. &ldquo;You must stop this nonsense.
You must get used to the trumpet or you never
can be a chapelmaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot do it, papa, I cannot do it,&rdquo; replied
Wolfgang. &ldquo;Please, father, send the trumpeter
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time, however, his father was remorseless.
He firmly held Wolfgang, and ordered the trumpeter
to sound one of his shrillest fanfares. Of
course he obeyed. Hardly, however, had he blown
the first cruel notes when the boy, with a cry of
pain, grew deadly pale. He trembled in every
limb, cold sweat stood on him, and he fainted.
Father Mozart was alarmed, and sent the trumpeter
away at once. When Wolfgang was himself once
more, his father went to the family physician, told
him his trouble, and requested him to assist in overcoming
his son&rsquo;s peculiar sensibility. The physician
reassured him. &ldquo;Do not worry about this, Herr
Vice Chapelmaster,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Medical treatment
can do nothing for him. Wolfgangerl is still but
a tender child, and the cause of his aversion to
loud, shrill, and piercing noises lies in his delicate
organism. Let him alone a few years. When he has
greater physical strength his dislike of the trumpet
will disappear of itself. But upon no account try
to compel him to become accustomed to it or
make any more such forcible attempts as you have
done to-day. It might be his ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="874" />
<p class="caption"><i>Hardly had he blown the first cruel notes when the boy, with a cry of pain, grew deadly pale</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>The father was relieved by the assurances of the
skilful physician, and did not repeat the experiment.
The latter&rsquo;s statements were ultimately confirmed.
Wolfgang not only became accustomed to the brasses,
but he employed them for years in his larger works
more effectively than any of his predecessors had
done. But though he could not yet overcome his
aversion to piercing noises, he could overcome other
difficulties with the utmost ease which would have
cost an ordinary person almost incredible exertion.</p>
<p>One day he determined to learn the violin. &ldquo;I
am no longer satisfied with the piano alone,&rdquo; he
said to himself. &ldquo;I must do something more in
music.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>All by himself, and without letting a soul know
what he was doing, he began the new study. When
his father was away from home he would take a
little violin which had been given him in Vienna,
quietly steal off by himself, so that his mother and
sister should not hear him, and practise assiduously.
Not a word ever escaped from him about it.</p>
<p>Some weeks passed in this way. A wonderfully
beautiful spring morning promised a perfect day.
Father Mozart could not let it pass without enjoying
it to the utmost, and invited his friends Schachtner,
Adlgasser, and Lipp to take a glass of wine
with him that afternoon in a beautiful little garden
near the gates of Salzburg, which was his personal
property, and which he often used in summer for
friendly gatherings. His devoted associates of
course gladly accepted the cordial invitation, and
the afternoon found them all in the garden. Frau
Mozart was not of the company, as she was detained
at home by household duties, but she sent the gentlemen
by Nannie a goodly supply of wine and cold
lunch for their refreshment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>The day was one of rare loveliness. There was
not a cloud in the deep blue, crystalline heavens,
and the jagged peaks of the neighboring mountains
stood out clearly before the eye. The rushing
Salza, like a great glistening serpent, wound through
meadows, fields, and clumps of trees. The trimly
arranged garden beds were rich with blossoms and
fragrance. Violets, lilies of the valley, and snowdrops
profusely exhaled their sweet perfume. Hyacinths
and tulips were arranged in their most
gorgeous colors, and the branches of the ornamental
shrubs, a short time ago leafless, were decked in
delicate mantles of green. It was an exquisite and
enjoyable scene. The friends revelled in the mild
spring air and admired both the wide, beautiful prospect
and the floral beauty near at hand.</p>
<p>After setting the table in the little summer-house,
Nannie returned home. The wine and viands had
been served, and the chairs were pushed back, when
Father Mozart heard a knock at the garden door.
Little Wolfgang and a family friend entered, and
were heartily greeted by all. &ldquo;A thousand times
welcome, dearest Wenzel,&rdquo; exclaimed the vice chapelmaster,
advancing to meet him and shaking both
his hands. &ldquo;This is fortunate, for you have come
at a most auspicious time. I am very glad to see
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>While the others were greeting the new-comer,
Wolfgang slipped away to one side lest he should
be seen and sent home again. He well knew there
would be music in the summer-house, because the
guests had brought their instruments, and music was
the joy of his life. No one paid any attention to
him. His father conversed intimately with Herr
Wenzel, a clever young violinist who for some time
had been taking lessons of him in composition; and
the others, even if they had noticed Wolfgang&rsquo;s presence,
would not have had him sent away, for they
were very fond of him. Young Wenzel admired
the beautiful garden and its charming location, much
to the satisfaction of Father Mozart. &ldquo;Yes, I am
very devoted to my little garden,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I never
enjoy myself more in summer than I do here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can well believe it,&rdquo; replied Wenzel. &ldquo;How
pleasant it must be to stroll here! How delightful
the prospect and the flowers! How one could
think and dream here! It must be a great satisfaction
to work, compose, and meditate in this
garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; you have hit it exactly, Herr Wenzel,&rdquo;
said Father Mozart. &ldquo;Whenever a good idea
comes to me it is here in this cosy solitude. But
what about your own affairs, my friend? You certainly
have not come out here without some good
reason for it. I see a roll of paper peeping out of
your pocket which looks as if it might contain
something nice.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Herr Vice Chapelmaster really should be
the Archbishop&rsquo;s privy councillor, he is such a good
guesser,&rdquo; replied Wenzel, blushing and slightly
embarrassed. &ldquo;I brought a few little compositions
with me, having learned from your good wife that
you were all here with your instruments. May I
ask you to run through them so that I may have
your judgment on them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; we shall be a thousand times glad to
play them,&rdquo; replied Father Mozart. &ldquo;What are
these nice things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six violin trios,&rdquo; answered Wenzel, taking
them from his pocket and handing them to Father
Mozart. &ldquo;Their composition has been a great
pleasure to me, but whether my poor talent will
satisfy you is another question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we shall soon see,&rdquo; said Father Mozart.
&ldquo;We will play the trios through and then have some
of the food and drink my good wife has so generously
provided. Let us get to work, dear friends.
You, Wenzel, shall play the first violin, friend
Schachtner the second, and I will undertake the
bass upon the viola.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>They were all willing, and went to the garden-house
where their violins were. The scores were
placed on the racks, the Instruments perfectly
tuned, and the playing was about to begin, when
little Wolfgang, who had quietly stolen up, lightly
nudged his father&rsquo;s elbow. &ldquo;What is it, child?&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;Where did you come from? Say
what you wish quickly, for we are all ready to
begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wolfgang had been concealing something under
his coat, but he now took it out, and his father saw a
little but excellent violin, which he had brought from
Vienna. &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; he said with
some surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means, father, I would like to play the violin
with you,&rdquo; replied Wolfgang. &ldquo;Please let me
play the second violin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you silly child,&rdquo; said his father, laughing,
&ldquo;what put such a notion as that in your head?
You can make believe you are playing with us, but
as to playing in earnest, you cannot do it. Perhaps
the time may come when you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can now, really and truly,&rdquo; said Wolfgang,
with flashing eyes and a look of absolute confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you learn to play the violin in your sleep?&rdquo;
said his father, jokingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, not in my sleep, but when I was awake,&rdquo;
replied Wolfgang. &ldquo;Just let me try once, papa,
and then I will explain it all to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father, of course, had not the slightest idea
that Wolfgang had secretly learned the violin, and
consequently thought the boy was only in sport.
&ldquo;When we go home, we will try a little minuet,
Wolfgang, but don&rsquo;t disturb us any more now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A minuet! That is easy,&rdquo; answered the boy.
&ldquo;Let me play Herr Wenzel&rsquo;s trio with you. Then
I will show you what I can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father now began to grow seriously displeased
at the boy&rsquo;s persistence, which seemed to him little
else than idle boasting, and he somewhat unwillingly
pushed him back. &ldquo;Go away, go away,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Because you can play the piano it does not follow
that you understand the violin. Go away, and don&rsquo;t
make yourself ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, father,&rdquo; replied Wolfgang, tearfully, &ldquo;it
does not require much skill to play the second
violin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Silly child; your head must be a little turned
or you would not talk such nonsense,&rdquo; replied his
father, at last really vexed, for he thought his son&rsquo;s
remark was disrespectful to his friends, Schachtner
and Wenzel. &ldquo;Go away, and don&rsquo;t annoy us any
longer. You need not fancy you know everything
because the good God has given you a little skill.
That is childish folly, and you must quit it. Remember
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wolfgang was so overcome by the harsh reproof
of his father, who was usually so kind to him, that
the tears came into his eyes, and he nearly cried
out loud. He sadly took his violin under his arm,
and was about to slip away, when just at the right
time his friends interposed in his behalf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him stay, Herr Vice Chapelmaster,&rdquo; said
Schachtner, &ldquo;and play with us a little. If he does
not make it go, it will be time then to stop him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Father Mozart, graciously,&mdash;for
in reality it had greatly pained him to be harsh with
his darling,&mdash;&ldquo;you can play with Herr Schachtner,
but play softly, so that we shall not hear your scraping,
and don&rsquo;t howl if any one says a word to you.
Come here and play, but, as I said, play softly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words sorrow disappeared instantly from
Wolfgang&rsquo;s countenance, and in its place came
a look of intense satisfaction. He wiped away
his tears with his sleeve, took his place by Herr
Schachtner, and the playing began.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>The piece was not very easy. Herr Schachtner
himself had to give his whole mind to it, and followed
it at first with such close attention that he
entirely forgot his little associate. But soon he
heard such a clear, pure tone at his side that he listened
with surprise, and watched Wolfgang with the
utmost astonishment. The child played with an
accuracy, precision, and purity which seemed to him
inspired. Delight and satisfaction were pictured
in his joyous manner and beaming eyes. Herr
Schachtner could hardly believe his senses. He
played more and more softly, so as not to lose a
tone of Wolfgang&rsquo;s violin, and after a little stopped
entirely, dropped his arms, and gave Wolfgang&rsquo;s
father a significant look.</p>
<p>Father Mozart himself had noticed for some time
the beauty, clearness, and correctness with which his
son was playing, and when their glances met tears of
joy and delight were in his eyes. The performance
was not interrupted, however. He indicated to Herr
Schachtner that he understood, and kept on playing.
Wolfgang was doing the same, for he was
so completely absorbed in his work that he had
not observed the little intermezzo between Herr
Schachtner and his father. He bowed and fingered
accurately and skilfully, and played all six trios
through, keeping up with the others without even a
hitch. When the last note was played Father
Mozart laid down his viola, joyfully hastened to
Wolfgang, took him in his arms, and kissed him.
&ldquo;Why, Wolfgangerl, you marvel, when and where
did you learn all this?&rdquo; he loudly exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;When you were at church or away from home
giving lessons,&rdquo; replied the boy. &ldquo;Did I claim too
much, father? Now you shall see that I can also
play the first violin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he had demonstrated his ability by actual test,
all were convinced that the seven-year-old little fellow
could accomplish even this more difficult task,
and they were anxious for him to begin at once.
He did so. He played the first violin, with several
curious and irregular fingerings, to be sure, but he
did not have to stop, and he kept correct time with
the other players. All were greatly pleased at the
surprise the lad had given them as well as his father
by his skill. The latter kissed and caressed him,
and the others heartily congratulated him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Wolfgang,&rdquo; said his father, when it was
quiet, &ldquo;some request of yours shall be granted.
You have given me great pleasure, and I am grateful
for it. Have you a wish? If so, mention it, and
I will grant it if it is in my power to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I have a wish, and a very pleasant
one,&rdquo; said Wolfgang, snuggling up to his father
and whispering in his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said his father, just as softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to make another concert trip,
father,&rdquo; said Wolfgang. &ldquo;I cannot tell you how
eager I am to get out into the great world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, my child,&rdquo; replied his father, with a
smile of satisfaction; &ldquo;this is a happy coincidence.
We have the same wish, for I have already decided
to undertake another trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where, father?&rdquo; asked Wolfgang, excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Paris!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Paris!&rdquo; shouted the lad. &ldquo;Oh, that is
beautiful, the beautiful thing I have dreamed of so
often. Let us go as soon as it is convenient. You
may be sure I will do my best when we get to the
great city.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>His father promised the journey should be made
as soon as possible. The company again assembled
at the table that they might congratulate him upon
his good fortune. They ate and drank, chatted
and laughed, expressing wishes for a happy trip and
a successful future, until evening came, and the joyous
party separated to meet at some other time.
All went home delighted, and Father Mozart most
delighted of all over this newly discovered talent of
his son, which justified the brightest hopes for his
future.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">In Paris</span></h2>
<p>A carriage was driven along at a
quick trot toward Paris one hot summer&rsquo;s
day, and had just reached the
village of Choissy, when the careless
coachman drove over a rock and upset the vehicle.
There was an outcry of alarm from the inside. The
door was forced open, and four persons crawled out,
one after another, and stood around the wreck in
dismay. They are old acquaintances&mdash;Herr Vice
Chapelmaster Mozart, his wife and children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is a pretty business,&rdquo; said Father
Mozart, indignantly. &ldquo;Here we are, hardly two
hours away from Paris, upset in a wretched village,
and, worst of all, with broken axletrees. We are
expected at an early hour this evening by Count
Van Eyck, the Bavarian ambassador, and now we
cannot get there before late at night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, dear husband,&rdquo; interposed Frau
Mozart, &ldquo;the accident is not so bad as it might
have been, for we have all escaped without injury.
Let us thank God, and hope that the little mishap
is not a bad omen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear, little mother,&rdquo; said Wolfgang, cheerfully.
&ldquo;I shall not break down in Paris. You can
rely upon that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Mozart had to laugh at the boy&rsquo;s amusing
consolation, and his indignation speedily subsided.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what has happened can&rsquo;t be altered.
With divine help we can bear this ill-luck
patiently. I wonder if there is a smith or a wheelwright
in the village who can repair the carriage.
Say, driver, how soon can you have the damage
your carelessness has caused made good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can go on in a couple of hours,&rdquo; replied
the driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what shall we do meanwhile to pass the
time away in this miserable spot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can help you about that, sir,&rdquo; said the driver
in a most amicable tone, hoping they might overlook
his carelessness if he were civil. &ldquo;The beautiful
castle, Choissy-le-Roi, where her Majesty the
Queen has her summer residence, is near here.
You can go there and stroll about the elegant park,
and the hours will pass like minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your suggestion sounds well,&rdquo; replied Father
Mozart. &ldquo;What do you think of it, dear wife?
As we have nothing else to do, suppose we go over
there a while.&rdquo; The mother gave her assent, and
both the children were delighted at the prospect of
frolicking about in the open air for two hours after
having been so long closely crowded in a carriage
on the dusty roads. They set off at once, while the
driver went for help to mend the broken vehicle.</p>
<p>The park, which they soon reached, was shadowy
and cool. The trimly kept walks were arched with
a roof of beautiful green foliage. Stags and deer
were browsing here and there on the grass patches,
and above the tree-tops gleamed the towers of the
castle, noted at that time for its stateliness. They
greatly enjoyed themselves in the cool shade, and
gradually approached the castle. No one was to be
seen except our travellers. Wolfgang noticed an
open door in a building standing by itself, which,
from its construction, he judged must be the castle
chapel. His curiosity impelled him to enter, and
Nannie and his parents followed him. It was a
fair-sized chapel and superbly decorated. A very
beautiful organ particularly attracted Wolfgang&rsquo;s attention,
and he could not resist the temptation to
play on it. As the chapel was empty, and no one
could be seen in the vicinity, Father Mozart ventured
to gratify his son&rsquo;s wish. He went to the
bellows, and soon a flood of beautiful, captivating
music streamed through the chapel and out into the
park.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Two richly dressed ladies of distinguished bearing
and unusual beauty were just at this time walking
in the park, and heard with surprise the wonderfully
rich tones which seemed to them to come from
the sky. They approached the chapel nearer and
nearer, and at last stopped and concealed themselves
behind some thick shrubbery, that they might enjoy
the magnificent music unperceived. It continued a
little longer and then closed with beautiful harmony,
softly dying away. Silence once more reigned in
the great solitary park.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is wonderful,&rdquo; said one of the ladies to her
companion. &ldquo;It seems to me I have never heard
such beautiful, such ravishing music before. Who
can the organist be? Our old organist is an excellent
player, but he has no idea of such melody and
harmony as that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish I will inquire,&rdquo; said the other lady;
&ldquo;but the quickest and easiest way would be to enter
the chapel and see for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, dear,&rdquo; said the first lady, about to turn
away. &ldquo;Those truly heavenly sounds have put me
in an exalted mood, which I would not have disturbed.
Let us go on. Perhaps we may learn in the
morning who this extraordinary artist is, and the
occasion of his performance.&rdquo; With these words
the lady turned into a denser and more shadowy
part of the park, and her companion followed her
without further suggestion.</p>
<p>Father Mozart and his family left the chapel
about the same time and happened to go in the
same direction. They intended to return to the
village and look after the carriage, but not being
familiar with the labyrinthine windings of the park,
which were made still more confusing by high rows
of yews and beeches here and there, they soon lost
their way, and after wandering about aimlessly for
half an hour they at last stood helpless. &ldquo;It is too
bad that we cannot find our way out,&rdquo; said Father
Mozart, with some uneasiness. &ldquo;The whole park is
deserted; there is not a person to be seen anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, father, there is!&rdquo; exclaimed Wolfgang,
whose sharp eyes saw everything, even through the
foliage of the hedges. &ldquo;Look there, father! Two
beautiful ladies! They can tell us and set us right
if they only will. I will go and ask them.&rdquo; No
sooner said than done. In his usually bold, informal
way, he ran up to the ladies, greeted them courteously,
and said in German: &ldquo;Beautiful ladies,
will you have the goodness to tell me where we
really are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ladies, one of them in particular, who was
of exceptionally distinguished presence, at first
seemed displeased with his boldness; but when her
eyes rested upon the pretty boy, who was accosting
her so familiarly, she smiled and replied, also in
German, &ldquo;In the park of Choissy, my little one.
You ought to have known that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I know that,&rdquo; answered Wolfgang,
&ldquo;but the park is so big and has so many walks, and
they cross and recross so often, that we can&rsquo;t find
our way back to the village whence we came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is another thing,&rdquo; said the lady, kindly.
&ldquo;You are now on the right way. Go down that
walk there and you will find Choissy on your left.
But tell me who you are, and how you come to be
so far away from Germany.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption"><i>He greeted them courteously, and said: &ldquo;Beautiful ladies, will you have the goodness to tell me where we really are?&rdquo;</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am Wolfgang Mozart,&rdquo; he replied, looking
as important as possible, &ldquo;and these are my dear
parents, and the little girl is my sister Nannerl.
We are on our way to Paris, where Nannerl and I
are to play before the King and Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, child!&rdquo; said the lady in surprise. &ldquo;What
can you play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The piano, violin, or organ, just which is most
desired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible! It is impossible for such a little
man as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it impossible? I played last winter
before the Empress Maria Theresa, in Vienna.
Why should I not play here? Have you not
heard anything about me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my child, to tell the truth I have not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you do not read the papers much,&rdquo; said
Wolfgang. &ldquo;They have had whole columns about
me. Try to remember, fair lady; you must have
heard of Wolfgang Mozart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be useless,&rdquo; said the lady, smiling, &ldquo;for
I scarcely ever read a paper. But it is a matter of
little consequence anyway. If you play at Court I
shall be there, and shall be delighted to renew our
acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! So you are also attached to the Court? I
am so pleased,&rdquo; said Wolfgang. &ldquo;When you get
there you will know all about me. I do not play
badly if I am a little boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said the lady to herself, &ldquo;can it be
possible that&mdash;listen, my child,&rdquo; she said, turning
again to Wolfgang, &ldquo;can you tell me who was playing
the organ just now in the castle chapel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was I, and my father was blowing for me,&rdquo;
replied Wolfgang.</p>
<p>The lady was overcome with astonishment. She
could hardly believe his assertion; but all doubt
disappeared when she looked into his frank, open
countenance and honest eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;if this is true, and I
have no reason to doubt it, then indeed you are a
great artist, and I promise to use all my influence to
secure your presentation at Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is splendid, and I thank you for it in
advance,&rdquo; replied Wolfgang. &ldquo;When you see the
Queen, greet her many times for me. The Countess
Lillibonne has already told me she is a dear,
good, lovely woman, and she certainly has heard of
the little Mozart.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;I promise you, my child, that I will convey your
greetings to her,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;And now adieu.
Your parents must be getting impatient, and I have
much to look after before the day closes. Adieu.&rdquo;
She extended her hand to Wolfgang. He kissed it
and took his leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a lovely lady,&rdquo; he said, when he got back
to his parents. &ldquo;She says she belongs to the royal
household, and has promised her help in securing
our presentation to the Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Mozart did not attach much importance
to chance promises of this sort. It was of more
consequence to him that Wolfgang had found the
right way to the village of Choissy, and thither
they repaired. They found the carriage all right
again, and resumed their journey to Paris, which they
reached without further mishaps before nightfall.</p>
<p>With his usual consideration and far-sightedness,
Father Mozart had provided himself with letters of
introduction to several of the best families in Paris,
which secured him an unexpectedly courteous and
kindly reception. The leading people planned a
public appearance for the children in a style befitting
their reputation, and succeeded in engaging a
prominent theatre for their concerts,&mdash;a favor rarely
granted to travelling artists. The concerts were duly
announced and given, and, as usual, Wolfgang was
enthusiastically received by large audiences of the
highest social standing. Father Mozart was greatly
pleased, for his well-nigh empty pockets were filling
up again with bright gold-pieces, and this of course
kept him in good humor. After a few weeks&rsquo; stay
the situation became still more satisfactory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>Baron von Grimm,<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> a friend of the family and a
German by birth, but very influential in Paris,
brought the welcome intelligence one day that the
family would shortly be invited to Court. &ldquo;For
some curious reason,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the Queen herself
has shown a most extraordinary interest in our little
Wolfgang. It is mainly due to this that we have
succeeded so quickly&mdash;more quickly indeed than I
had expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said Wolfgang, gleefully clapping his
little hands, &ldquo;do you not see, papa, this is the work
of that beautiful lady at Choissy? She has at last
accomplished what she promised.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;What lady?&rdquo; said Baron Grimm in surprise.
Wolfgang and his father by turns narrated the little
adventure in the park of Choissy, and Baron Grimm
smilingly but eagerly listened. &ldquo;Ah! is that so?&rdquo;
said he in a somewhat significant tone. &ldquo;The
riddle is now clearly solved. This is a very agreeable
surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when shall I play before the Queen?&rdquo; said
Wolfgang, impatiently. &ldquo;I am very eager to
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon, perhaps, my child,&rdquo; said Baron Grimm.
&ldquo;It is not possible to say exactly when, but we will
do all we can to hasten the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wolfgang was satisfied with this assurance. He
was not kept on the rack long, however, for, a few
days after this, Baron H&eacute;bert, the Queen&rsquo;s lord high
treasurer, was announced, and invited the family to
be present at an appointed hour in her apartments
at the palace of Versailles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>The hour came at last, and Wolfgang found himself
in the midst of the splendors of the French
Court, which eclipsed those of the Court in Vienna.
The highest nobility of the land, arrayed in gold-embroidered
costumes and blazing with diamonds,
were assembled in a grand salon from which opened,
right and left, elegant suites of rooms flooded with
the brilliancy of hundreds of wax tapers. The
family could see this magnificence only from a distance,
for the King had not yet appeared, and his signal
had to be awaited before they could enter. After
a little, a movement in the salon indicated that Louis
the Fifteenth had entered, and about half an hour
later Baron H&eacute;bert accosted the family. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo;
he said in a pompous manner; &ldquo;his Majesty orders
that you be presented to the Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They followed him. As they entered the salon,
Wolfgang, not in the least embarrassed by the
splendor, uttered a cry of joy. He saw the lady
with whom he had conversed in the park of Choissy
and gazed at her with sparkling eyes. &ldquo;Oh, it is
so nice that you are here,&rdquo; he said excitedly, at the
same time kissing her hand, which was graciously
extended to him. &ldquo;You have kept your word, and
I heartily thank you over and over again. But tell
me, where is the Queen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you not divined, dear child?&rdquo; replied the
lady, with a smile. &ldquo;I am the Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am overjoyed,&rdquo; exclaimed Mozart, surprised
and delighted. &ldquo;I shall love you still more, for
you have been very good to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this,&rdquo; turning to a gentleman standing
near her, &ldquo;this is his Majesty, the King, who
also wishes to hear you play.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Wolfgang bowed gracefully to his Majesty, who
acknowledged the courtesy with a slight inclination
of his head. As he did not clearly understand the
situation, the Queen explained how she came to be
acquainted with the pretty child, and then Wolfgang&rsquo;s
father and sister were presented. The King
addressed a few kindly words to each, and then resumed
a card game with some of his courtiers. Wolfgang
continued his conversation with the Queen, who
also presented him to the French princesses, Victoire
and Adelaide, both of whom fortunately spoke German.
Victoire, the younger, was greatly interested
in Wolfgang, for she had heard glowing reports about
him from others and was herself a clever musician.
While Wolfgang was having a pleasant chat with
her, the King suddenly turned round, and, looking
up from the card-table, said: &ldquo;Eh, bien! Are we
not soon to hear our little musician?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>There was a deep hush at these words. Wolfgang
and Nannie, acting upon the King&rsquo;s suggestion, instantly
went to the piano and began a four-handed
sonata, which they performed with great skill and
brilliancy. In fact the children played with extraordinary
effect. The King, however, did not stop his
card game, and as he apparently paid no attention
to the children&rsquo;s playing, the rest of the company
followed his example. The performance would
have passed entirely unnoticed had not the Queen
and Princess Victoire listened with the closest attention.
They rewarded it with hearty applause, and
sought to allay the feeling of disappointment which
the indifference of the rest of the company had
caused. The sensitive feelings and artistic pride of
the children had been deeply grieved, however.
The tears came into Nannie&rsquo;s eyes, and Wolfgang,
indignant at the conduct of his audience, made no
effort to conceal his anger. &ldquo;Come, papa,&rdquo; he
said in a loud tone to his father, at the same time
slapping the leaves of his music-book together,
&ldquo;come, let us go. It is easy to see that these
people know nothing about music.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>The vice chapelmaster was alarmed at this loud expression
of his son&rsquo;s indignation. He feared, and not
without reason, that they might incur the royal displeasure,
and he also realized the harm it would do
them in the world if it were known that Wolfgang&rsquo;s
playing had failed to make an impression at the
French Court. He kept his presence of mind, therefore,
and quietly said: &ldquo;Just as you like, Wolfgang.
We will go if you are resolved not to play any
more, but think how you will feel when the world
says, &lsquo;Little Wolfgang Mozart has failed at the
Court of Versailles.&rsquo; How could you stand such
disgrace? And the world will not fail to say this
if we sneak away now without accomplishing our
purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, father,&rdquo; proudly replied Wolfgang.
His sense of honor was now aroused for the
first time, as could be seen by his flashing eyes. &ldquo;I
will make them hear me, and once they listen I shall
succeed.&rdquo; Boldly advancing to the card-table, he
bowed, and said to the King: &ldquo;Will Your Majesty
have the kindness to give me a theme for improvising?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King looked up with surprise, for it now occurred
to him he had been so engrossed with card-playing
that he had utterly forgotten the children.
&ldquo;Ah, it is you, is it?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What do you
wish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wishes you would give him a theme for improvising,&rdquo;
promptly replied the Princess Adelaide.
The King, with an exclamation of surprise, cast a
searching glance at Wolfgang. &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;Try this,&rdquo; humming a melody from a favorite
opera at that time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope to satisfy Your Majesty,&rdquo; replied Wolfgang,
with confidence, as he returned to the piano.</p>
<p>The King&rsquo;s attention had been aroused by the
boldness of the child, and although he did not stop
his game, he heard Wolfgang&rsquo;s playing just the
same. Suddenly he laid down his cards, arose, and
said to those around him, &ldquo;This is really extraordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wolfgang heard him, and there was a gleam of
triumph in his face. He continued playing with
increasing beauty, power, and brilliancy, and closed
with a technical display surpassing anything ever
before exhibited. Now all were attentive. Only
the tones of Wolfgang&rsquo;s music were heard in the
great hall. The Queen and the princesses listened
with delight. Tears of sympathy stood in Princess
Victoire&rsquo;s eyes. The King remained standing, overcome
with astonishment, and now and then passed
his hand over his brow as if to convince himself he
was not dreaming. As the last note died away, his
loud &ldquo;brava&rdquo; was the signal for such a storm of
applause as had never been heard at Versailles
before. Princess Victoire, unmindful of Court etiquette,
rushed to Wolfgang, embraced him, and
kissed him repeatedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Besides the Queen, there was another lady present
who at that time had great influence with the King,
and consequently was all-powerful at Court&mdash;the
famous Marquise de Pompadour. Like the rest,
she was overcome by the fascinating performance,
and expressing to the King her wish to see the boy
more closely, he brought Wolfgang to her. &ldquo;A
little man,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but a great genius notwithstanding.
Put him on the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was done. When the beautiful Marquise&mdash;for
she was really an exceedingly beautiful woman&mdash;looked
at him with her large, brilliant eyes and
smiled, Wolfgang bent forward to kiss her. He
was not a little surprised, however, when she drew
back and turned herself away. He could not restrain
his impetuous disposition, and in his deep
mortification he cried out contemptuously: &ldquo;Ah,
who is this that will not kiss me? Has not the
Empress kissed me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately for him, and perhaps for the rest of
the family, he spoke in German, and no one at Court
understood that language except the Queen and the
princesses, who were not at all displeased at the
contempt which Wolfgang then and afterwards displayed
for the hated Marquise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>To prevent any further imprudent outbreaks on
the part of the audacious little fellow, he was induced
to return to the piano, where he delighted the
company anew with his charming and graceful playing.
He also repeated the feat of playing upon the
covered keyboard, which he had performed for the
Emperor of Austria. It was greeted with even
more applause and made a greater impression than
his legitimate playing, and this still further vexed
and angered him. &ldquo;They do not understand
music here at all,&rdquo; he said to the Princess Victoire,
to whom he had freely opened his heart. &ldquo;You
are the only exception, and I will play for you as a
token of affection. Give me some task to perform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of one?&rdquo; replied the princess. &ldquo;Can
you play a minuet and write in the bass part beforehand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? I can if you will give me the melody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princess requested her music teacher, Mons.
Le Grand, to arrange a minuet theme for Wolfgang.
Le Grand obeyed, but with a doubtful shake of the
head. When it was ready Wolfgang took the composition,
went to a desk, and without stopping or
hesitating an instant, wrote in the correct bass.
Mons. Le Grand was surprised, for, though he was
an excellent musician, he could not do anything like
that. It was an easy task, however, for Wolfgang.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, child, since you have successfully
performed my sister&rsquo;s task,&rdquo; said the Princess Adelaide
to him, &ldquo;will you try another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; replied Wolfgang. &ldquo;What shall
it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something very difficult,&rdquo; said Princess Adelaide.
&ldquo;I will sing an Italian cavatina which I know by
heart. Do you think you can accompany me on
the piano without knowing the melody, entirely by
ear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is impossible, absolutely impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mons. Le Grand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not very easy,&rdquo; said Wolfgang, &ldquo;but I will
try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down to the piano, and Princess Adelaide,
who was really a fine singer, began the cavatina.
Wolfgang accompanied her, imperfectly of course,
and sometimes incorrectly, for, as every musician
knows, it is almost impossible to divine every modulation
and digression in an unknown melody. The
princess had hardly ended before Wolfgang requested
her to repeat the cavatina, and this time accomplished
what human ears had seldom, if ever, heard before.
He not only played the melody with his right hand,
but the bass accompaniment with his left, apparently
with the greatest facility. Ten times over he requested
the princess to begin again, and each time
he played an absolutely correct accompaniment, each
time varying it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>The performance was simply incredible, and it is
not remarkable that this feat of almost superhuman
skill was greeted with a storm of applause. All were
enraptured. Princess Victoire took Wolfgang in her
lap, hugged and kissed him as if he were her own
child, and gave him a magnificent diamond brooch
which she unfastened from her breast. The Queen
lavished dainties upon him, and fed him as if he
had been a little bird. Even the King conversed
with the sharp little fellow, his replies being translated
into French by the Queen. The troop of
courtiers stood staring at the wonder child who had
thus been honored above all other artists in the
world.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">The Cavalier of Music</span></h2>
<p>After six months&rsquo; stay in Paris, the
Mozart family left France, going first to
England,<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a> and thence to Holland. Wolfgang
was very ill at the Hague,<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> but
speedily recovered, thanks to the careful nursing of
his parents, and resumed his studies with renewed
zeal. Paris was also revisited, and about the close
of 1766, crowned with the laurels of fame, he returned
to Salzburg.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Wolfgang spent a few years there in quiet seclusion,
interrupted only by a visit to Vienna, where
he distinguished himself on several occasions, and
won the esteem and approbation of the famous
Chapelmaster Hasse.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a> He also received at home
a distinguished honor for a boy of twelve, from the
Archbishop of Salzburg, who appointed him concert
master of his chapel after repeated tests of
his ability.</p>
<p>Everything conspired to increase his fame. His
artistic skill was admired and appreciated wherever
he went. There was but one thing lacking in his
effort to reach the summit of his art&mdash;the approbation
of Italy.</p>
<p>Italy was at this time the home of art. The
greatest musicians and composers lived there, and
it was Wolfgang&rsquo;s highest ambition to secure their
recognition and to win honors at their hands. &ldquo;To
Italy,&rdquo; was his watchword. Although his father fully
appreciated the risk of the experiment, he at last
yielded to his son&rsquo;s solicitations. The Italian journey
took place in 1769. This time father and son
went alone. Nannie remained at home with her
mother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>There was at that time a Philharmonic Academy
in Bologna, which was recognized throughout the
world as the final authority in all musical matters.
Musicians considered it the highest honor to be a
member of this Academy, and with good reason, for
those only were admitted who had passed the severest
tests. Padre Martini,<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> universally recognized
as the most learned of musical scholars, and his
faithful friend, the renowned singer, Farinelli,<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a> who
had retired after receiving most extraordinary honors,
and was living at a charming villa near Bologna,
were at the head of this famous institution. They
were acquainted with the reputation of Wolfgang
Mozart, and they were not surprised, therefore,
that when he reached Bologna he expressed the
desire to become a member of the Academy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Padre Martini, as well as Farinelli, welcomed
Wolfgang with sincere cordiality, and his agreeable
and unaffected demeanor soon commended him to
the good-will of these renowned men. His extraordinary
endowments were quickly recognized and
appreciated by them, and yet Padre Martini doubted
whether the boy could pass the severe examination
necessary for admission to the Academy. He did
not conceal his doubts from his friend Farinelli.</p>
<p>One day, after Wolfgang had called upon them,
Padre Martini said to Farinelli: &ldquo;This boy certainly
is a wonder child and a rare flower of our beautiful
art, but it is my duty to assign him the severest of
tests, and I fear he is not skilful enough to succeed.
&lsquo;I fear,&rsquo; I repeat, for the lad has won my heart, and
I shall be deeply grieved if he fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not share your apprehensions,&rdquo; replied
Farinelli. &ldquo;His career abroad, as well as the proofs
of his ability at home, speaks for him. Paris, London,
Holland, and Vienna have been captivated by
this wonder child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, &lsquo;by this child,&rsquo;&rdquo; answered Padre Martini;
&ldquo;but Wolfgang is now leaving childhood. Although
a boy, he is no longer a child, and he must now
establish his claim as an artist. Though all the
world may recognize him as such, he must first of
all demonstrate it here. If our decision should
elevate him to the rank of Cavaliere Filarmonico,
his fame will be established. His piano, violin,
and organ record cannot help him here. He must
prove that he is a scientifically educated musician,
and thoroughly grounded in counterpoint. It is
this that makes me doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we shall see,&rdquo; replied Farinelli, who had
greater confidence in the young man. &ldquo;What test
will you assign him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most difficult one I know,&rdquo; replied Padre
Martini. &ldquo;He must set an antiphon from the
Antiphonarium, in four parts.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a></p>
<p>It was Farinelli&rsquo;s turn to be anxious, for the test
was so hard that its accomplishment required an
absolute and perfect knowledge of musical science.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought not to require that of him,&rdquo; he said,
with some emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must do it. He must submit to the most
difficult test. The boy is yet very young, and the
honor of the Academy is at stake,&rdquo; replied Padre
Martini, unmoved by his friend&rsquo;s protest. &ldquo;If he
do not succeed it will be no disgrace for one so
young, and he will have the consolation of knowing
that older musicians have failed in like manner;
but should he succeed in this hard contest, then,
Farinelli, his fame will be as lofty and enduring as
the stars.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;Manage this matter according to your best
judgment,&rdquo; replied Farinelli, for he realized that
nothing could induce the resolute old master to
change his purpose. &ldquo;For my part I wish the boy
success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more than I,&rdquo; said Padre Martini, with
emotion. &ldquo;I love this child with my whole heart,
and for that very reason I would have him accomplish
something great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wolfgang in the meantime awaited his hard task
with a serenity which would have appeared foolhardy
had he not been sure of his ability to overcome
the greatest difficulties without much exertion.
The gifted boy had not passed his leisure days at
Salzburg in idleness. He had resolutely and industriously
devoted them to the study of his art,
both practically and theoretically. He had thoroughly
analyzed the compositions of such great
masters as Stradella, Scarlatti, Durante, Hasse, Bach,
Handel, and others, and counterpoint had no difficulties
for him. Knowing that he was well equipped,
he eagerly awaited his test, anticipating it with impatience
rather than with anxiety. It was the height
of his ambition to show the world that he was a
recognized master of music, and thus secure the
friendship and esteem of Padre Martini, whom
the Italians almost worshipped, and whose judgment
on all musical questions was all-important because it
was absolutely decisive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>On the day fixed for the test the cultivated
people of Bologna were all astir. A great crowd
gathered in front of the large and elegant building
where the Accademia Filarmonica held its sessions,
and waited with intense eagerness for the result of
the test. The public were not allowed to enter the
building, but awaited the news of the victory or
defeat of a candidate, which was announced from
a balcony. This was the old-time custom. The
people already knew and admired young Mozart,
for he had roused their enthusiasm by his wonderful
playing in his concerts, and when he made his
appearance about one o&rsquo;clock that afternoon at the
hall, an enthusiastic &ldquo;Evviva&rdquo; welcomed him on all
sides. His frank, handsome face showed no trace of
anxiety or doubt; on the contrary, he mingled with
the people as freely and with as much unconcern as
if the coming hours did not affect his interests, his
honor, his fame, and his future, all of which were
at stake. Should he fail, his artistic career would be
at an end, and the laurels he had won would be of
no more value than heaps of dust and ashes. He
might be assigned a fair place in the ranks of artists,
but no one would concede him any higher position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Knowing all this, Wolfgang was calm when he appeared
with his father, whose face wore an anxious
look, in the hall of the Academy. Padre Martini,
Farinelli, and all the other members at that time
in Bologna, most of them old and famous chapelmasters
and composers, were already assembled there.
They received the boy in a dignified manner. It
was a solemn moment. Father Mozart&rsquo;s heart
beat with secret fear and his limbs trembled, as
he stood before the stern and stately judges of his
son. Wolfgang, however, was undisturbed as he
looked at their array, but he displayed no sign of
overconfidence.</p>
<p>After the formal greeting Father Mozart was
conducted outside into the library. Wolfgang was
requested to approach. After a few instructions
the judges arose and handed him the paper containing
the test. It was, as Padre Martini had said, the
arrangement for four voices of an antiphon from
the &ldquo;Antiphonarium Romanum,&rdquo; which Wolfgang
must accomplish in a closed room, three hours
being allowed for its completion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Wolfgang took the paper, made a low bow of
reverence, and with quick step and confident manner
followed an official, who conducted him to
an apartment and locked him in. Anxiously and
with secret misgivings Padre Martini and Farinelli
watched the exit of this boy so full of life, animation,
and courage. They had ample reasons for their
anxiety, for they knew of course the difficulty of the
test. They also remembered that many clever
musicians had been wrecked by it, and that others
had labored the entire three hours, exerting their
utmost ability to arrange an antiphon of even fewer
parts. The members watched him go in silence.
Here and there they whispered together. Padre
Martini and his friend Farinelli walked quietly up
and down the hall. All were deeply moved. The
majority of the judges wished the young candidate
good luck, but there were some who were envious
of the young artist&rsquo;s ability and secretly cherished
the hope that he would not accomplish his task.
Eager expectation was visible on every face. Some
were anxious and hopeful, others were jealous and
envious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Thus a half hour passed. No one dreamed that
the painful waiting was so nearly over, when the
door of the hall was suddenly thrown open, and
the official who such a short time before had locked
Wolfgang in his room, entered. He looked pale
and uneasy, and was evidently overcome with astonishment.
&ldquo;What is it? What has happened?&rdquo;
asked Padre Martini, breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Signor, I am almost afraid to tell you,&rdquo; replied
the official. &ldquo;I can hardly trust my own ears.
The young Mozart has given the signal that he has
completed his task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible! In so short a time? Impossible!&rdquo;
exclaimed Padre Martini, his face growing somewhat
pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; repeated several other members,
who were amazed at the official&rsquo;s announcement.
&ldquo;The young man is either foolhardy or out of his
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall soon see,&rdquo; said Padre Martini, calmly.
&ldquo;Nothing is impossible to a great genius, and
Mozart&rsquo;s genius is far above the ordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Academy has flourished a hundred
years, and such a thing as this has never occurred
before,&rdquo; said one member.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;That has little significance. What has never yet
happened may have happened now,&rdquo; replied Padre
Martini, who tried to conceal his anxiety behind outward
composure. &ldquo;The signal has been given. Come,
gentlemen censors, and receive the young man&rsquo;s work
and test it here <i>in pleno</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They arose and followed Padre Martini, who led
them with quiet dignity, though at heart he was
not so quiet as he appeared. He was really afraid
Wolfgang had underestimated the difficulty of his
task and made errors. His heart beat violently as
the official unlocked the door, and his eager eyes
rested upon young Mozart, who was standing in
the middle of the room in his easy, careless manner,
with uplifted head, smiling countenance, and eyes
glowing with the certainty of success. He handed
the paper to Padre Martini with a graceful bow.
The latter took it and cast a hurried, anxious
glance at it. Almost instantly his face lit up with
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has succeeded,&rdquo; he said to himself with a
sigh of relief. &ldquo;It is greater, grander, more artistic
than I had dared to think or hope.&rdquo; Then he
turned in a dignified manner to the censors: &ldquo;Let
us return to the hall, gentlemen. The work of the
young musician must be thoroughly analyzed and
passed upon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>With a gracious inclination of his head and a
smile of delight, Padre Martini took leave of Wolfgang,
who was again locked in to await the final announcement.
Nearly an hour had passed when the
boy heard some one hurriedly approaching. The
door was again opened, and Padre Martini with tears
of joy entered and embraced him. &ldquo;Come with
me, my son,&rdquo; he said with choking voice, as he led
Wolfgang back to the hall.</p>
<p>When the youth entered by the side of the grand
old master all the members arose, greeted him with
long-continued and enthusiastic hand-clapping, and
shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evviva il maestro! Evviva il Cavaliere Filarmonico!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wolfgang was pale with joyous excitement. He
had achieved his most glorious victory. His work
had been unanimously adjudged the highest honors.
He was now a member of the Academy, a recognized
master, a knight of the exalted art to which he had
consecrated his whole life. Two arms enfolded him
with affectionate tenderness&mdash;the arms of his happy
father. Wolfgang shed tears of delight. There was
a silence of sympathy in the hall, broken all at
once by the jubilant shouts of thousands in the
street, the acclamations of a vast multitude resounding
like the surge of the sea, and repeating the same
words which had just rung through the hall:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;Evviva il maestro! Evviva il Cavaliere Filarmonico!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this inspiring and exciting scene Mozart&rsquo;s
boyhood closed. He was no longer a child.
Though in years a boy, in deeds he was a man,&mdash;a
man in the full sense of the term, a sovereign in the
empire of music, the idol of the Italians, soon to
be the favorite of the world. What the child had
promised, the man had achieved. His works bear
witness to the greatness of that achievement. They
shine like brilliant stars in the musical firmament.
They assure his universal and imperishable fame.</p>

connected with it.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_6" href="#fr_6">[6]</a>Mozart&rsquo;s full name was Johann Chrysostom Sigismund Wolfgang Amadeus.
He was the youngest of seven children. In the family he was addressed as &ldquo;Wolfgang,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Wolfgangerl,&rdquo; the termination &ldquo;erl,&rdquo; like &ldquo;chen,&rdquo; being a diminutive,
and used as a term of endearment.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_7" href="#fr_7">[7]</a>Mozart&rsquo;s sister, Maria Anna, was born Aug. 29, 1751. Her household name
was &ldquo;Nannie,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Nannerl.&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_8" href="#fr_8">[8]</a>Andreas Schachtner afterwards was the principal trumpeter in the band of the
Archbishop of Salzburg. His father was also a trumpeter.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_9" href="#fr_9">[9]</a>This was a work of considerable importance, entitled &ldquo;An Attempt toward a
Fundamental System for the Violin,&rdquo; published in Augsburg.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_10" href="#fr_10">[10]</a>Nissen, one of Mozart&rsquo;s
biographers, says this concerto was written with a full
score of accompaniments, including even trumpets
and drums. This, however, is
probably incorrect, for the compositions of his
earlier period are mainly for strings,
and the few wind instruments usually found
in the small orchestras of that period.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_11" href="#fr_11">[11]</a>The word &ldquo;concerto&rdquo; in this connection is probably used in its old restricted
sense, when this musical form resembled the sonata. The modern form of the concerto
was fixed by Mozart, but at a later period in his life.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_12" href="#fr_12">[12]</a>The first of Mozart&rsquo;s compositions catalogued by K&ouml;chel is a minuet and trio
for piano. Upon the manuscript, which is still preserved, his sister has written:
&ldquo;The undersigned witnesses that this piece was composed by her brother in his
fifth year.&rdquo; The original is without title, and bears the date 1761.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_13" href="#fr_13">[13]</a>Linz, the capital of upper Austria, is a city of about 50,000 population, on
the Danube River.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_14" href="#fr_14">[14]</a>In a letter written Oct. 16, 1762, Mozart&rsquo;s father says: &ldquo;The following Tuesday
we reached Ipo, where two Minorites and a Benedictine, who had been our
companions on the water, said mass, between which our Wolferl rattled about on
the organ, and played so well that the Franciscan fathers, who were entertaining
some guests at dinner, quitted the table, and, together with their company, hastened
into the choir, when their astonishment was inexpressible.&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_15" href="#fr_15">[15]</a>Georg Christoph Wagenseil was born Jan. 15, 1715, in Vienna, and died there
March 1, 1777. He was the Court composer, organist to the Dowager Empress
Elizabeth, and music master to the Empress Maria Theresa and the imperial princesses.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_16" href="#fr_16">[16]</a>Andreas Schachtner, Court trumpeter, in his recollections of Mozart, says:
&ldquo;If a trumpet was held before him, it was like putting a loaded pistol to his ear.
Papa, wishing to overcome this childish dread, on one occasion told me not to mind
this aversion, but to sound the trumpet near him. Scarcely had Wolfgang heard
the shrill sound when he turned pale and began to sink to the ground. Had I gone
on he certainly would have fallen in convulsions.&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_17" href="#fr_17">[17]</a>Baron von Grimm was a distinguished German-French critic and author,
and one of the most brilliant literary celebrities of this period.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_18" href="#fr_18">[18]</a>Mozart and his father left Paris for London, April 10, 1764, and remained in
England until August 1. The children were kindly received at Court, and made as
usual an extraordinary impression.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_19" href="#fr_19">[19]</a>Upon arriving at the Hague, Mozart&rsquo;s sister was first taken ill, and then
Mozart himself took a violent fever, which lasted several weeks. It was nearly two
months before he could play in Holland.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_20" href="#fr_20">[20]</a>Johann Adolph Hasse, a distinguished dramatic composer, was born March 25,
1699. It was Hasse who said, after hearing Mozart&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ascanio in Alba,&rdquo; written
when he was thirteen years old, &ldquo;This boy will throw us all into the shade.&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_21" href="#fr_21">[21]</a>Giovanni Battista Martini, usually called Padre Martini, was born at Bologna,
April 15, 1706, and was one of the most learned musicians of his time. He left
many compositions and some important works in musical literature.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_22" href="#fr_22">[22]</a>Carlo Broschi Farinelli, born at Naples, Jan. 24, 1705, was a famous soprano

the more important parts of plain song.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
